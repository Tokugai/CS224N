You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can see you as a farmer or a leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epidemics.
And you know that an epidemic generally is something that you fall somewhere in place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as an epidemic.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollywood.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the '60s in the middle school, at Story, Ohio.
When they were beaten to blood every week in the children's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when she allowed me to go into the teacher's bathroom.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the '80s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call of that teacher, Mr. Poetry who said, "I need to see you.
I'm definitely definitely never going to meet us.
You could come to Ohio and please bring that man I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We went to see it, we laugh, we were flood, and we realized that she needed to be hospital.
We found it a place, we interacted it, and we looked at it, and we commissioned their family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to meet me as an adult came to meet me, he became a tennis box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed up, had become a circle -- and that episode that I told you was done in itself.
The epidemic is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about a lot of this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first pictures.
I was amazed.
My heart came fast, I was seriously, trying to understand what I was in front of me.
The pictures around the water are almost 60 meters, and I couldn't think that it was a snow copy on another snow of snow year after year.
The pictures are born when they get rid of the glaciers or break the ice barriers down.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are refuse to stay down and hold up to the end, whereas others can't afford it more and demonstrate in a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a iceberg -- that are isolated separate and alone, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As a iceberg melts, I'm breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg is melted by a water release water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I approach these pictures as if it will be about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when they're slowly, it's not an end, but a continuation of their way by the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the pictures that photography is very young, it has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in Kellah, Greenland photographer.
It's a little bit frequent to really get a real iceberg to get a bribe.
Here you have.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your flow line.
You can see here, it starts to stretch, the ship has moved down to the other side and the man is there.
This is a team of Greenland in average size.
So about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so you know, the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every one of a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the concept of you, you're not going to pay attention.
Think about that for a moment.
And in this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is attached to the X charge of the egg.
And in the other case, the chromosome X of sperm is attached to the X charge of the egg.
They both learn and start life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my active activity, it will be two roles.
In one of my roles I work with the history of the anatomy of the animal.
I'm a structure of training, and what I study in this case is the way people embrace the anatomy -- I mean, of human and animal bodies, how they have considered body fluids.
The other role I challenge in my work is an activist, as a patient defense or, as I say sometimes a disease of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working for example, for example, with massive twins, two people within one body.
I've worked with people with instances, much lower than average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with outliers, who are individuals whose physical psychology doesn't fit in male schemes and conventional females.
In general lines, we can call it impressive.
The interpretation is adopting many ways.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in the male or male forms or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with cosmic basic X-ray whose German gene of chromosome and says to the prototypes, that we all have in the federal life, which become texture.
And then, in the hot life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks from testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the insulin syndrome to antibodies.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops a typical female course.
When the baby is born, the baby has a little girl.
It's a girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until the puberty -- when it's growing and developing the bears, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having ovarian and the tissue, it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you may think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, like men, we have something called supercomputer globalized.
They're in the back of the body.
Supermarket glands produce ants, the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a typical woman, does not know their cosmic structure, I think I would be a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to anthropologists.
We produce ants and respond to anthropologists.
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the ants that the woman who was born with testicles that have the sensitivity of insulin to the ants.
That's why sex is something complicated. It's not that the interpretations are in the middle of the spectrum, in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as you would -- I had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, I was wearing a life as a boy, and I just discovered that I had ovarian and the time.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as a frozen supernatural hypothesis.
He had 20th chromosomes and the superstar glands were so active that essentially they created a male hormone.
As a consequence, their geniuses were made malefully, their brain was exposed to the typical massed hormone component companies.
He was born with a child, no one suspected anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by internal message, when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of impression.
Some people with 20th campaigns develop what is known as an American -- that means they have a service of the service wrapped in a texture tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that kids with these kinds of bodies -- -- they're forest, size twins, or intriguing them -- they are structural surgery is not to be able to make a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that you get to various surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings a particular identity.
We have the idea that being women is to have female identity -- supposedly being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
Really simplistic idea.
And when you introduce a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with cancer.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture about individual.
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic indigenous.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside of one body.
The most accurate case is last year with the South African corridor Carter Semisphere, put on his sex in the International Googles of Berlin.
Many journalists called to say, "What are you going to do to determine whether Santa Semisphere is man or women?
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't take a line between men and women or between men and interpretations and women and interpretations and women and interpretations, we are all of us who take that line.
So what we have is a situation in which the more the science is, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable anatomic categories that correspond directly with stable infamin categories -- they're much more disappearing than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out a lot more complicated than the terminology allows the terminology to allow us.
As we see, we get into a dear terrain.
So look, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What will we think about the fact that they are just a few numbers of nuclear?
And as we progress in science we get more and more in an uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we manage are probably too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the realm of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body gets human and it has different rights than the features of the features.
There are very isolated discussions today -- not in public -- but I know within medicine -- about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to go with this question of whether someone was dead.
Like a lot of them put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still they didn't understand it.
If I stopped moving it out.
But today, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to face the dilemma to really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this catalog explosion could get someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, giving people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
And I will conclude that these categories are much more unstable.
You think about the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fertilized fertilizer of the parents.
I know they were racist -- I know they were separate, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and head and so radical in what they did, I find myself every so much watching that music currently committed "Bear "This music "Are "Bear "This music -- "Askeley and not by the music, which is totally spending.
That's what happened in 1776 with the Parks Foundations.
The Forter parents were for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explained why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and they replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers -- what we rejected our Parks was the idea of monority. The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the animal.
The monkeys of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth right.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that it came to the political power for the right of blood transmitted from the grandfather to father and then the son, etc.
The Fords Foundation rejected that idea and replaced it for a new anatomical concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They revealed the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the analysis -- that was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of an integrated system where they were making two things.
The democracy was getting rid of democracy and at the same time born science.
And it was very clear, if we looked at the history of the Father Forests, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
They were being distracted from supernatural explanations and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power transmitted by a vague idea of birth right.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of independence, they talk about nature and God from nature.
Don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence we were getting rid of the idea of anatomical coincidence.
And by doing so, they were sitting on the foundations of the future of Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women were travel.
Then I came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the Parket of Super Truck, who said, "I'm not a woman?"
We found men in the lines of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color who went back to the anatomic coincidence about the analytical difference, and again, they were translated.
We see the same with the disability movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the coincidence we have to start asking why we keep certain dinosaurs.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomical divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should go to the anatomy of the animal.
I don't want to say that the five years were supposed to be allowed to have sex relationships or married.
There are some anatomical divisions that for me make sense and I think we should keep on.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings that are considered at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conditions in the middle of 1979, exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born in term, was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary is attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because he has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other areas in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it's X-ray, in virtue of being considered man now is possible from mandatory transformation that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary on its part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So they still have analytical categories that in various aspects are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science goes so much in the field of anatomy that we get about to have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could demonstrate them?
I don't want to quit science, but at the same time I feel like science is stretched.
Where do we go?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it."
But many people are stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman to get a woman, and to have a chemistry.
Now, in practice they don't do chemicals to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the insulin syndrome to antibodies.
If you look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "You have a solution.
It says that we should judge people not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their cartoon, going beyond the animal.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks really good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their cartoon?
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be based on this to get them rights to the people, because I have to admit that I know from some of the people who are going to be able to come up that the social services that some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some workers that I know can make more informed decisions, smart and marriage about their sexual relationships than people who I know.
So how do you put it in practice the issue of the cartoon content.
It's very difficult.
And one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe a magnetic resonance market.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to guide this stream of thinking in relation to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to be killed, unless it's willing to join a sex change, which case it allows it to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago and then separate them and then accept their family.
But when the phone asked him the rate of operation was a very risky operation, he said that in that other country, these kids would be very malaria, and therefore I had to do it.
And what I said, "Well, have you considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who they are without forcing them to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, in closing, I mean I've been talking a lot about the parents.
And I want to think about how democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we have given greater participation to the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different anatomical psychologists, particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years ago, since I've been interested in impression, I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about cultural studies is that women, in average, not all, but in average, tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism -- -- I was considered feminist, like now, made me a strange plant.
"Tell me what the feminist is from female."
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Shoulders has to do with getting gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in the feminist."
But the more I think about his question, the more I have seemed like there's something female in feminism of me.
That means that there might be something -- in average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very reluctant to find a way to protect people by the state of the state, it is possible that, of having injected more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of reciprocal support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy -- thinking less about the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect unit, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family thinks where it wants to go live and work, it has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents to attract to new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is they value much more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily deliver the world to the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this can sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just replace it by apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those who want to live in apartments are already property and that the other half is still missing to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make amazing applications in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you face is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the metaphorics and the distribution of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those amazings.
But you could go to a totally new place, build a completely new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place facilitate the construction instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that governments create new kinds of big reform zones to contain cities and give them a name, under status cities.
Later, I learned that more or less at the same time, Japan and eighth were thinking about the challenge of reform Honson.
They knew that every year around 75 hours would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Hongs.
In the summer of 2009, Housan went through a destroyed constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, Pete Louis was arraying absolutely with a platform in which promises reformers and at the same time.
He asked Oprah to be his boss of cabinet.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of perfection and trial and error and a lot of trials with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under status to their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and hurt all of the current apartments of apartment apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules to progress and usually are the rules that prevent us to move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to eighth a link with TEDTalk.
I showed it to Japan.
They called me.
They said, "Let's introduce this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami in a conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, the land that in some cases, they go thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, October said, "Wow, maybe we could see the video of the TED Talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a single city under status is a place where you start with pop-up land, a statue that specifies the rules that will be applied there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of Honson called me, and he told me we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go to Tunisian and speak again about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, who tried to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Dentine and the white line is the new airport that was built in Dentine.
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the honors that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that measures at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody applied companies.
The public faces were very serious and attention.
The leader leader approached the platform and said, "Professor Rome, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this in my computer."
So I sat and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explains the essentials that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could go in Honson, rather than hundreds of miles away to North north.
And it also includes new choices for leaders.
Because the women's government leaders would need help from associated countries, they could benefit from the associated countries that would help them establish and make the standards of the status -- so they could all trust that the status is effectively done.
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily be about a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to fear their Constitution and add a constitutional device that would allow these special regions of development.
In a country that just went through this painful crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional performance was 124 to one.
All the parties, all the factors in society, and they got it.
To include the Constitution, you have to play twice in Congress.
The 17 of February was approved again in another voting of 14,000 to one.
Immediately after voting from 21 to 24, a demographic of about 30 honors was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is building in South Korea, is bigger than the Boston center.
All you see there was built in four years, after four years were getting permission for four years.
The other country in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to come, and at the same time allow it to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the ultimate instant instant for this new judicial system.
There are urbanizations and building cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know has already solved is that they have a good number of hospitals.
There are many companies who want to install in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to immediately change another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job -- sometimes they're similar mothers that have to win money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in Hongs?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my homeless friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm Jesus, and this is my value.
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public trust, and it's that, I live with the suits.
I love to find, see, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog block broken, colorful, and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of thumb market and standard stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my ship in the environment and in my bill.
I get to meet interactive people, usually my money goes to a good cause, and I will buy it into my personal search for teachers.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is my street?
Would I like the color?
Will it cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the theme of my value, I want to tell you what I started for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you get someone who has all that cloth?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought out.
I've brought seven pairs of internal clothes, and nothing else.
And I run inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my value.
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else I wanted to use after getting here to Palm Springs.
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks at TED in inner clothing.  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting.
While I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
This is what I call a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the story, including the jacket -- I was 25, and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
Moon, color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be a bad mood, when you're looking at a brilliant red screen.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars, interaction is saving.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you surround the right people, you won't just understand you, you'll also appreciate you.
Miracters. Guilt of the kid you take inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the descriptions, or I remind them to their small age seven.
I like to smile them and say, "Thank you."
Justines: The confidence is key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no look at that you can't attract you.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Leavers, a universal truth six words for you. The golden letters go with everything.
And finally, standardized, developing a personal and unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried it over and over again when people came up with this week just by what I was using -- and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all this is not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to go emotionally to these things, because on the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, colorful and brilliant waiting for me, if there's a little love in my heart and looking for it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we use a scale to measure each hemisphere, we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical one.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where would you take your brain on this scale?
Some of these things will operate for one of these extremes -- but I think for most of the interfaces of this audience, their brain is something -- with a great attitude in both hypertensions at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually exciting.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, which as most of the other experimental physicists, we need a lot of logic to capture these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty much intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them, and then we see how they react -- and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
Certain intuition that you may have developed with the years of the years is that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion of it.
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, it always fell down.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar showed you a valuable lesson -- and that is that big things are not allowed to transport them, and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars -- play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations and called it quantum mechanics theory.
And at that point, the physics was found a few years ago, you need quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But they didn't need it to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a particle before.
But it also didn't fit to my logical part.
Because if it's all made out of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics -- then shouldn't it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics?
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a quantum mechanical superconductor.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the metal little I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the small metal rate.
What we see is a little little bit of metal and training and supporting supported in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this orchestra with form of swimming paradox that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superintelligence, but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up and let me do those things, because I don't want them to bother them, or, actually, to use.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave the same way.
The travel companies of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that goes up and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passwords.
And that's what we did.
We turn out the lights, then we introduced a vacuum and we extract all the air, and then we cooled it into a temperature of less than a degree for absolute zero.
Now, by being alone in the elevator -- the little piece of metal is free to act like this.
So we measured their movements.
We found it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating -- and the way that I came up was like a breath in this form -- like a fire that's expanding and against it.
And by giving a smooth pump, we could make it vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a virtual and not vibrating thing at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the tricks of atoms that make that piece of metal are still, and at the same time those same atoms are moving down and down.
It's just in certain instincts when those are standing.
In the rest of the time they're delivered.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which at once means that all of the metal fish is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
I was worth getting into a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, you see this, the difference on scale between one atom and that metal little metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one atoms can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places. Why don't you do it?
I mean, it's my logical part that I talk about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How would you act your consciousness if your body was delivered in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we heat it, and we looked at the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition -- apparently all objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are simply made in a small space.
You hear a lot about quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep range of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amiora.
And 18 months ago I had another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and allowed me to take it up.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, you assure it, with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on demand.
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explained simply in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education, but I didn't get access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums. I started learning a lot.
And working in Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than it shows the demo for then to explain a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, just just go to George.
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the Ushabi gallery -- Mommy, Emiath, Richards, the Google Google.
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to Mexico, the New York Art Museum in art.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and, "Paul -- we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, Bombia or Microsoft, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get fun.
Do you want to navigate the museum?
We opened up the flat plane, and with one click we jump inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall.
They go forward. They get fun."
explore.
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
I'm now in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Counterings of Peter Britain in the Metros.
I see the sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's the whole information information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the giant technology.
So this picture, for example, contains -- I think, about 10,000 million papers.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 million peeks?
So I'm going to show you what you really get to 10,000 million papers.
It can take around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really wanted to deploy.
So I started playing and I found something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems interesting."
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some of the Mexico people, and I actually discovered that this is a game called "Bankershan," which is to hit a time with a stick on the Saradi Mars.
And it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper in depth and see that you can really get to the Greeks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to zoom up the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump back to MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night startles?
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the papers?
And if you want to see how van Google actually created this master work?
You increase it and really do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this frame, and I'm really going to get to the Greeks.
This is "The Star night? I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things beyond here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called "College Collections."
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a management, that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go in, -- I've created this function that I call "The Power of The Tomorrow," -- we just made a round around it.
It's about "The National Gallery in London.
You can bring things together, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you get these master masterpieces together.
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice for your artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the big question they do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum?
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a short, a flying summer.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Iraqi Iranian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of their dorm -- but the reason I show you this is that something really interesting about formula in Drugmard 1 in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a Drug 1 career, I would take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering is called a real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two components. A sensor and an accident.
Now what's interesting today is that control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They are becoming computers in the air.
And, as such, they're starting to respond in a different way, and they can be detected and active.
Cities is a big thing.
And as I noticed that I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the world's cortex but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these devices and activities are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of Paul Antarctic in the Mamma of MoMA, during the summer.
It's called "Talk To "May?
Well, our objects, the environment, start talking about.
In a way, it's like almost all existing atoms become sensors and accidents.
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old dream of Millenda Angele.
You know, when Michelangelo I sculpt the Moscooks, he says that at the end I took the hammer, and he brought it to the Mosques -- you can still see a little millimeter under it, and he said screaming, "Did you have no paradigm? Why don't you talk about?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk about.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples, insisting in the idea of capturing the environment and performing something.
Let's start with detection with it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup, the year.
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end of Zimbai, he gave the head.
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the activity happening on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Copenhagen in the middle and the Torah River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
For the early afternoon, there are people over here, and there are called moving, moving.
It starts the party, silence.
Grand de France.
Interviewer: people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of regular time.
First additional time, second time.
Zikilh, and at a moment, the head.
He won Italy, yeah.
That night everyone went to celebrate the center.
There you see the great peak.
The next day they all went to the center to the finance of the winning team and the first minister of then.
And then everybody came down.
You see the image of the place called Circle Massaches, where the Roman time, people are going to celebrate -- it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection is not about people, but of things we use and consume ourselves.
Today we know everything about the production of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac -- how they are standing up.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash into the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little over a year ago, to tag what they were going on, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that you can see anyway.
Then we put them a little chip, a tag on the trash and then we started to track it.
These are the results.
Part of Seattle.
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of benefits in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist.
They are happening complicated things, and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing we think is that if we look at every single day that the cup that we raise doesn't disappear, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we fly on one day is still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague at MIT, Assacion Biosearland, could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we mentioned at the beginning, which is to act about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in Grandma.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a chart and valves, solar valves that open up and shut down.
It's created as a water cut, with water papers.
If you fall out the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, text.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to Mayor Bell.
He liked it a lot.
And it triggers a commission to design the building to the entrance of the Experiment.
We call it Palestinian Water Palestinian.
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows -- but when you zoom up and open up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the salaries, the roof goes down.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there and said, "Democratic the building."
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost all the architecture disappear.
Here it is working.
You see the people embedded by what happens inside.
And here I am trying to not get me by testing the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in Marily came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was going to open up to let me go, but a building that kept making cutting and water holes, and you had to jump out not to get wet.
(Audience noises) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give us our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical peeks, the water pixels and the projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter like the one that we saw before, that moves with others in synapse.
We could form this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the peeks.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes.
And then all of that could be a cloud of penguins in 3D that you can zoom in, and you can see from very diverse angles.
This is the real Columbia Colorado, going down to form a V, like before.
When the light, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bollywood -- one of the best ballet dancers of today, the New York City star and the Millennium School, to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pets, the chapter in different resolution.
It's so much 3D dioxide in real time as motion capture.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible entry for Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as a cloud of clouds -- like the grain crash, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody donated a little bit for a short.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us, we can move out of the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may want us to use it to design and make a symbol.
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today, think of climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to go from digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud they're paper.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered of peeks.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympic Googles and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's just a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital sheet at night, but most important is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory, for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in a better shape, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe of themselves?
What about good health?
Or maybe they're those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you like to like?
What would you like if you could choose something?
It's about Audience: creativity, creativity.
How many people will choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
A few times. It was probably due to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you will choose memory?
A few more.
What about the physical state.
A little less.
How about longevity?
Oh, most people. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a permanent theme here at TED conference, but today I want to give you the view of a doctor on the subject.
The great gene of the 20th century, T. Jamaicans, who also joined the Church Olympic Russia, wrote a trial called "No biology makes sense to the light of evolution.
But if you effectively accept biological evolution, you consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well in an end, is of course, the most interest us.
We left a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interface there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of home.
Some have gone back.
We've been here about 130 years old.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin, but it's the same protein, chemically indicator, where the pancreas comes out.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the most bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio Machupoe would pose the airline -- think about bacteria -- think about bacteria?
The gut is a wonderfully hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, wet -- it's very application.
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that can want without effort of their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some posed supply to the output.
But therefore, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest essential nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would the future?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or do we become something different, perhaps better adapted to the environment?
In this vast cumulative symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief behavior, the animal kingdom, as one and only companies, and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entire part of this talk, so I hope that you've enjoyed it.
When I went back to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the single-celled organisms, every single cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughter cells.
But when molecular organisms disappear, things start to change.
It enters the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens genome, the rest of the body becomes pre-everyday.
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was college student, I thought, well, sex, sex, sexual death, it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year I spent -- it was getting more doubt.
I came to understand the feelings of George Burns, who still acted in Las Vegas well in his 90 years.
And one night someone hits their hotel door.
He opens the door.
And in front of him, you find a wonderful slight dance of clothes.
He looks at it, and he says, "Come for a sex support.
"It's good," says, "Get George, "I choose the support."
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of evolution, not necessarily controller, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to keep us healthy.
I wanted to regain health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to spend genome to the next generation, adapting and survival generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like refugee rockets to send the genetic burden to the next orbital level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that Woody Allen expresses Wood Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to make it not dying."
Evolution doesn't necessarily favor longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the most fast and even the most intelligent one.
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures to their environment.
That's the only survival test and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the emerging bacteria that can survive the heat of the firms that will produce, if there were fish there, fish cooking the cow, yet they've managed to make that an advanced environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the next phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that by medicine in the first place, we've been able to preserve lots of genes that otherwise would have been discarded and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have confused our environment for us to adapt to us as well as we adapt to him.
And by the way, we migrate, we carry, and we get so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation necessary for the evolution.
A second possibility is that you can produce an evolution of traditional type, natural to the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be, that the entrepreneurs of evolution are going on, but they're incredible.
And in terms of illusion, when we kind of collect distant planets are going to exist the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural ways.
But there's a third possibility -- an attractive possibility.
The neuroscience call the new evolution, which is not simply natural but wearing and chosen by us as individuals in the decisions that we will make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more variations than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it takes at the individual and family level.
Think also that if you could be able to be able to choose not just the sex of your disconnect, but in your own body to make genetic adjust to cure or prevent disease.
What if we could do genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the apple?
Wouldn't they want to make those changes in their genes.
If you look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
It cost 1,800 billion dollars.
The next year of having done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a nearby cost at 20,000 and in a week of a week.
I'm not going to take a lot for the human genome for 1,000 and more and more and more and more to the scope of everyone.
Those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that aren't just going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity.
Believe or not there is an experimental trial in course with the vaccine against cross-section of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the table?
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only another two little changes.
Can you change the cells of your bodies, but if you could change the cells of your discussion?
What if they could change sperm and valleys, or change the fresh flower, and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate the hypothesis, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any healthier children?
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to also adopt specific survival specialists, a better memory.
Why not have the engineering of a Ken Jones especially if you could increase it with the next generation of the Wattricus machine.
Why not have a faster password muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live longer.
This is going to be irresponsible.
And when we are in conditions of spending this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution before in the neuroscience.
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years old, and we can compress it to 1,000 years, and maybe it happens within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
Are we going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more considered?
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more unique or more rural and more version?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all, are we going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom required to make these decisions continue?
For good or for worse, and before what I might think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor by clicking click, class, class.
Clap, click, click, clay. It sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the 12.
It was the only one who could talk to flight seats.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. We probably hit some birds."
The pilot had already looked at the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot links the plane with the Hudson River.
That's not the route of it.
It took the motors off.
Imagine being in a plane and no noise.
And then he said three words.
The three more dispersed words I've heard.
He said, "President for the impact.
I didn't have to talk more about flight sense.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was finished.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to repair all the experiences I've wanted to have and never had.
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, "Collection came bad."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to apply anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we avoid the George Washington Bridge Washington, which was not for much -- I thought about, well, I really feel a big speak.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also gave place to my ego.
And the time I wasted in things that didn't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a medium in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels great.
I don't try to be right. I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be disconnected, 18, 14, 13.
You see the water approach.
I'm saying, "Please go fly."
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we were born, I had the feeling of which I was like, well, I don't fear fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for that all our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go, I love my life.
And that sadness came into a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- side.  And scream -- look, like a little bit.
And for me, that was the whole reason of being the world.
At that point I understood by connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is a good father.
I came up with a miracle of not dying that day.
And I came up with another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You're flying today, the challenges that you imagine the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be like that -- but imagine and how do you change?
What is it that they would do, they still hope to do because they think they're going to live forever, for always?
How would they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents that you can do?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called TED.
TED was one of the most important farmers in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel a high stress in the legs.
And that was the beginning of the ALS.
Textile today has a total paralysis.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to sponsor Tony and TED, and its cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him.
And I said, "A second, not that you see Stephen Hawking, isn't that all people with paralysis can communicate through those apps?
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?
Does anybody see the movie "The Faith and the Marios?
They communicate in that way -- they go through the finger.
I said, "That's architecture. How can it be?
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a box that had no idea how he was going to cover it.
I engaged with his brother and his father there at that precise moment, "All right, this is the thing: Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside of their inner cannot be connected."
So I talked about a couple months later.
I met these guys called GPS Reservation Lab, who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser dot, draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that come up, they say, are part of a life cycle.
First they start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his presentation.
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much move the things from one side to another, we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine for TED to communicate -- a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun. I call him Angel because when I talk to the guy, you get an email of him, and you say, "I don't deserve it. This guy is fantastic."
The other thing we did was we bring seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the planet to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved back to the back and these hackers and programmers and consumers and antibiotics took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid and that when we came back would have removed the squares of the walls and instead there would be graffiti.
But for two weeks, we went on to the marine season of Venice, my son was part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called Edina Device, and you can see the description of it.
They're a couple of gardens of subsidies that we bought in the Mars Beach, some copper wire wire and Thomas Department and Radio Shake.
We take a PRISPA camera, we open it up, we put it on a light of LED and now there's a device that is free -- it builds yourself yourself, we publish the free code -- the software goes down.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was impressive.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the TED room.
I love this picture because this is the other person's room, and that's his room.
There was all this volunteer and advantage during the great interface.
And after more than a year of planning -- two weeks of programming -- intense sessions.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of its life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a project on a wall of the hospital statement.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking station.
The funny thing was that we had to break into parking so we felt like we were reading graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water, and somebody finally came to rescue me and I would get out of there so I could breathe.
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our scream of war.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing us.
And we have a long way to run with this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a magic screen.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and do it faster and really robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of prize.
Remember, it's free. None of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes went from the guy, "Oh, this is fantastic."
Armstrong tweet something about us, and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 invented inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the circle. It's that in April this year at the Georgetown of McDonald's in the center of Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "Art in the Cats in the Streets."
And "Art in the streets is going to have the best experts of urban art and Sheika Father, Casas -- all of them are going to be there.
TED is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, make it possible.
None of what's in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the Medicarpola, the Columbiack, nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it possible, anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with eye recognition. I just recognized something and associated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do every day when we meet something that we feel that we feel that you have to do. If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, who?"
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years getting into a very difficult situation and at the same time a lot dangerous.
I went to prison, hard.
I worked on a coal mine.
He filmed in war areas and difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been setting up in stress situations with the only goal to try and examine social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and, hopefully, analyze them in a way that they look at entertainment and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the sponsor I wanted to do something a little different.
So some may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a bird in E.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following: "Hey National NGO -- present, my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and on content I could exploit it on the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company by doing it.
But said this, it's a very good media opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's a program in progress, by the way.
So even with that saving knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I hadn't been able to tell you with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of the marketing of the public.
And as I said before, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could be anticipated, for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Stroflo, I want to make a film that is trying to make the production of products and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is funded with production of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest movie ever selling."
What happens in "The largest movie ever sold is that everything on top on the bottom, in the beginning at the end, has marketing images, all the time, from the autonomous that appears before the title, the X brand.
Now this brand, Multer Station, the States Center.
These people are going to be associated to penishing personality.
And so the film explores all this idea. Michael Kasansan, it's reduction. Is it what? MK: Is it resident? A personality, forever forever forever for me?
I'm a reduction person. MK: I just say that. It was more for information.
It was "Per Penturity. forever."
But we're not just going to have the tax of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure we're going to ensure all the categories we could in the film.
Maybe we have a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you have used.
The most cool car you've driven in "The largest movie ever selling -- the best wheat you have been, cortexis of "The biggest sale ever selling "click."
David Koldolati: The idea is then besides showing brands as part of life, making them fund the film? (MM: To fund the film. MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the full film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the film, in principle at the end.
And I would love that CED helps make it happen.
Robert Fried: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that, it's the ultimate respect for audience.
GG: However, I don't know how Rezero people are going to be.
MK: You have a perspective. I don't know if "Wow is very negative, but you know how it's going to reproduce? (MT: No idea. David Changelle: How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half a half --  -- John Kamen -- I think it's going to be hard to meet the meeting with them, but not doubt is going to be worth convincing a couple of big brand.
MK: Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we look at us as a lot of joy.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Russia, most answers will be no."
MS: But will it be hard to sell it, for the film or to be me?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So, do you help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. MK: Okay. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what marks do.
MS: Yeah. MK: That's the challenge. When you look at the people you have to treat.
MK: We have some places where to go. (M. OK. Turn the camera off.
MS: I thought "fit the camera -- meant we have a conversation outside of a microphone.
It turns out the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your movie.
MS: And so it was, one for one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very impressed -- I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the media separately, is not the idea to tell you with that new magnificent vehicle that is going to take the message to mass?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a graduating mistake and that mistake was this.
No, no such error.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what it represents this picture.
See, when you look for transformation images in Google --    this is one of the first images that appear.
I like your way to slow, Sergey Brita. No.
This was the problem: transparency. free of simulation or design, easily detected or seen, easily understanding, which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in business practices -- being the last line maybe the largest line.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name it, the president of the name, even the CEOs name it.
But suddenly when it's about making it reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear --  like that weird bear that still keeps playing.
It's unpredictable.   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What other thing is risk?
You will eat a whole cup of Costa White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you tell your story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in some lie -- and he was looking at me as he used to do it, he said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But just one company, an agency wanted to help me -- and that just because I met John Bond and Richard Kiribati in many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my account, I would have to take away in the interest and go to the companies myself.
So what I started to warn suddenly -- -- what I started to realize is that when you start to conversation with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, huge, giant movies and others who do small movies, independent like mine.
And my friends who do big Hollywood movies, giant giants, say that the reason their films have so much success is due to the safe brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movie movies?
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever selling "The Greater Movie."
How are we going to see Bank specifically in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my bottle, you'll see the Banglade Bang.
At any point during an interview with somebody I can say, "Are you okay for this interview?
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to calm up.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview."
And there would be one of these fabulous arms.
Both "Florida Florida as "Vinci "The Park will have their opportunity.
We're going to have both for man as a woman, solid, back, barbed, like that.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a permanent look.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
So similar to the kind of smaller movies that you counted -- we're more well a rival brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands in them.
So doing things like this, you know, remember Barn to people that's why this interest us.
MS: What words would you use to describe Bank?
It's in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Woman: higher technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the standard.
Man: Let's talk about something audacious and failure.
I think "grade is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus the smell and the subject."
You keep you cold.
How do you keep yourself more time? With better farm, more fraud, three times more fair.
Things like those who take the benefits out.
MS: And that's a multi-sharp company.
What about me? What about a common kind?
I need to talk to the man from the street, people like me, to the common Lesins.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your market?
Man: Mmm my brand?
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: I will reverse the '80s, "Adaptary Puncility unless it's a day of laboratory.
MS: Okay, what is the Green brand, the Greenland."
Germany: Something unique. (Me unique. Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a dark glamour."
I like dark colors, lots and things like that.
Usually I take access like sunglasses, or I like crystals and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a classic conversation, Merchands Benjamin.
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it car flight.
Woman 2: In part hippie, in a part of a boy in Bill Brooklyn, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of markets.
I'm selling toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I get the marketing.
Man 5: March 5: Faith.
Is that something?
Laboratory, I'm a lawyer.
Take: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand Tom, but I often classify to the intersection of dark glamour and car flight.
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the "arrest of the market."
And I found a company called Olesconds Zalla in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Nigeria, February, Leolardo to discover that basic person.
If you could do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
Adapt: Bring the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you live, as people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things are originated and start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, and they start in the West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is this was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about why. What does that mean?
What's the male? What phase do you find now?
Why is it important to reinterrote? What does the red mean?
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's not who you are.
What other marriages have you have?
It has to be fear. What kind of Russian mountain are?
MS: Air."  Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, '60: Big work? AO: Thank you very much. Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy in all this.
Linus Zalamara: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but complementary -- in your brand personality -- Dr. Super Subatin is a recycling brand.
They spread very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong dots or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's human nature -- to avoid the things that they're not safe -- avoid fear, those elements and you actually give them saving and make them become something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic one, Apple.
And you can see it also here to Tasta, Wikipedia, Minister of Ministon Cooper and Jewish.
Now there are playful marks and conscious brands -- those things that have gone and come but a leadership brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A private brand. What's your brand?
If someone asks you to describe your identity identity, your brand personality personality, what would you be?
Are you a crazy attribute? Are you somebody who makes blood flow.
Or are you a defense attribute?
A little bit more called, reserved, conservation?
The array attributes are like being fresh as the Princeton, contemporary and adventure, asteroid or bold like Erito Florida, fast or girl, professor, dominant or music or mystic like Gandhi.
Or are you more attributed attribute?
Are you conscious as a 7077?
Are you stabilized, traditional, proposition, protection? Do you identify with Opera?
Are you confidence, stable, family, trust, safe, sacred or contemporary or wise like the Dalai Lama or Ander?
In the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies and advanced and destined, who said, "No, they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control about the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the neuroscience, and we got to tell the story in this film of how they are now using magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain as much for commercial marketing as for movies.
We went to San Paulo. We went to San Paulo.
Throughout the city for the last five years, there are no values, no cards, no venture, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are making road in schools with light problems in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or the most successful answer is the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these marks did.
They took the international ones, they took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have gone? Did they succeed.
Well, since the film is starting at the Stanford Festival of San, let's take a look.
According to Burrans the movie started in January, and since then, and since then, and this is not all -- we've had 900 million impressions, in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two and a half weeks.
That's just online -- no press, no TV.
The film is still not distributed.
It's still not online. It's not in study.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talk about to their customers will not be part of it.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take people out of that you're pushing them into failure.
I think that when you train your employees in the risk of the risk you're preparing all your company to get representative.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to rise.
We have to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can use.
Ultimately, I'm going to move forward, I think we have to give fear to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
Let's take the fear. Let's take the risk.
From a coincidence at a time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to get to transparency.
Today, more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk "We "Do the Transparency has been presented by my good Emi friends who by 75,000 bought the rights of the name in E.
EM: turning big data into large opportunities for companies around the world.
Emergy presented "Well the Transparency.
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, Morgan, in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those 75?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket I have a box for the name of the matrix of TED, the Saliana Foundation, a check for 75,000 to be applied to my TED assistance for the next year.
The idea behind the Stario computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the entrepreneurial plant of Uranian in Nation.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and volcanoes, we can cause a lot of problems with the central control.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software -- they're from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to confirm this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind Station.
We started with a Windows installed installed.
The ship goes into the gray box, damage the central control, and the nuclear program is demographered, most mentality.
Is it easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research about Station six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of Windows -- the installed used multiple values dark.
It seemed to do something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That was called attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Steven and we saw what happened with this.
So very strange things.
Steven would behave like a lab of lab that he didn't like our cheese computer, but he didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different cheese flavors -- I realized, and I thought, "This is a direct attack.
It's completely saving."
The installed is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working in that place.
So no, Steven doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what the goal is.
It might be, let's say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better we will discover the target.
So we extracted and we decorate the attack code, and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs, a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the points that I can attack.
You probably even know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the Statue installed is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this attack code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old self-definition language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we looked for at first were called functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for temperatures and data structures and we tried to relate to the real world, with objective potential of the real world.
We need theories on determitations that we can approve or prove.
To get to theories on goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent speaker, it must be a valuable white, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been represented.
You don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It's basically reduced to the Bush nuclear power plant and the National Media Media.
So I said to my assistant, "Transparent a list of all the experts in central centers and power plants between our clients."
I called them and I turned them into an effort for controlling their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital board with the control of the robot.
The robot is that mobile part inside the central center, that black object you see.
If you manage the speed of this robot, you can certainly bring it up and even make the central explosion.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and describe in an obvious effort to get crazy to nest maintenance engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital board looking very closely at data and their structures.
So, for example, the number 160 supports in that code, cannot be obvious.
I started investigating scientific literature about how these central centers are built in National and found that they're structured in what's called a ship, and every waterfall contains 160 cents.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These settings in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the attack of attack?
It's almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.
So it wasn't like that.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
We were routinely finished in cells and we had to start again.
And yet, we found that both digital offices pointed on just one and a goal, but from different angles.
The small ship is taking a waterfall and making the rocks and relieved it, and the big ship communicates with six shores and manipulating valves and manipulation.
Instead, we're very confident that we've determined what the determination is.
It's National, and it's just Nation.
We should not worry about other goals that are reached by Steven.
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really impressed me.
There is the gray box, and you see the central stories.
What this thing does is to intercept the values of the sensors, for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provide legitimate code, which is still running during the attack, with false input data.
And believe or not, this false input data is predicted by Steven.
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the robot, the security camera is feeding the present video.
Is it great there?
The idea here is obviously not just to burn the operators in the fourth control room.
It's really much more dangerous and a very aggressive thing.
The idea is to break a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes out of speed, you have to open up school tubes.
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're committed to, then they can spend bad things.
The plant can explode.
And not the operations or the security system will notice it.
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is general.
It has nothing to see, specifically with centralities, with uranium entrepreneur.
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant, or in an automotive factory.
It's great.
And you don't have -- -- -- a little bit of an attack, which will disseminate this burden with a USB key, as we saw in the case of Steven.
You could also use conventional tons of worms to disseminate it.
It will look at the most possible.
And if you did that, what you're going to end up with is a carbon of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We have to face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Raley, it's been public in many sides that people assume that the Musey is the main entity behind this.
What is your opinion?
Ralph Langelback: Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. Okay.
My opinion is that the Musey is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is cyber superintence.
There's one single one, and that's the United States, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately.
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for announcer. Thank you, Ranci.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give it to be substantial skills, or another one that makes users of wheelchair wake up and go back to walk.
In Berkeley Bionics, we call these robots, excellents.
They're nothing different from something you put in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing your speed, and helps you, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- you can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other external ones.
This is not a real idea.
To show you now in what we're working on to talk about the American soldier that, in average, it has to take on its back a 40-year-old burden and it's getting even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complexities -- lengths on the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the HIV -- or Port Chart Cars.
Soldier: With the HIV exoskeleton I can put 90 pounds by variable terrain for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put you in caps and execute movements with great addiction.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then increase my strength and my resistance.
Eighty Benjamin, we're ready with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new exoskeleton this year.
So that's a reality.
Let's go back to the wheelchair users on the wheelchair, and I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly in wheelchair, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens with frequency -- very young people, with the drugs in the backbone that when they start their life -- the 20, 30 or 40 years old -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is aging that it multiplear quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complexity -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful apartment, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you the EEG who is using Amanda Boro who was using Amanda Boro who was 19 years ago, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Bortan, thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our ELAMS, which I said.
It has some sensors.
Completely not investment in the crutches that send signals to the bottom computer, here on the back.
Here's a few batteries that give energy to the motors in the caves, and in the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural standard.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom of the stream.
In a second, I lost all feeling and all of the penis moving down.
Shortly time, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "Lime, you'll never walk.
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last fish of hope of my being.
And the technology of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn how to show me costs down on schools, climbing rocks and even riding in a hand bicycle.
But they haven't invented anything that allows me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just from soldiers, but to Amazon, and all the wheelchair users to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battery, practice sex to say hole, and play is order of the day, where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of the Arabic Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living parts.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their agriculture.
But unfortunately, we've done too much historical about this aspect in our narrative of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, and the brands society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where death violence hasn't yet seen.
But unfortunately, Bonobos are the least understood of the great apes, unfortunately.
They live in the depths of the Congolese forest, and it's been very difficult to study it.
The Congo is a paradox. A land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the tip itself, stage of a violent conflict that has been produced for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
The hunting of hunting and deforestation makes you can't fill a stadium with the bonds that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter by getting the trees.
Who are these first prime?
We know them as the apes "do the love, not war, because they have frequent sex, programmer and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the Samuron Surface.
Bonies like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and foster tolerance and formulate.
With him we learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the evolutionary roots themselves, the dance and the human ritual.
The game is the glue that binds us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild medium.
First of all, it's a Bonobo blogger game, and I don't talk about football stuff.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a perception.
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have the piece of the balls."
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as well as humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the investment of bringing unusual elements to play -- like the tests -- and also how the game requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is politics.
The game is politics, it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more crazy, imagination, curious -- maybe the place where the awe is reduced.
And I want you to see -- this is Future, a young female, who's playing with transparent water.
I think that as her, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and external worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real sex of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our advance of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But would we leverage the maximum of our game capacity.
The game is not freedom.
The game is essential.
For bonds and humans alike, life is not just cruel and departed.
When it looks like the least appropriate play, they can be the moments in which it's the most urgent thing.
So, primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we cut creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin House.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I fight fires like capture sense in a body of volunteer bombs.
And in our city, where the volunteers are comparable to a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to go into action.
I remember my first incentive.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still there was a race against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found Captain -- I was faced in a conversation with the owner that no doubt was going on one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a paradigm, on paper, decorating, while his house was in flames.
The other volunteer I had just got before I was -- let's call him Slow Luther --  -- first of the captain and he asked her first to go and save the dog of the house.
The dog." I was so choose."
There was a lawyer or a management of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building to save a live self just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me an administration.
He said, "Beasts, I need you to go into the house.
I need you to go up, throw the fire, and I bring this woman a couple shoes away.
I drop.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but I was -- put the stairs, at the end of the hot, I went to the real firemen that at that height or less had finished to turn the fire and walked into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my character back to the ladder where I met my Museum and the precious dog in the main door.
We took out of the house the teachers for the house of house where, as it was waiting to expect, his teacher received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house of the house added by the courageous effort shown to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at about the other was that somebody had reached a couple shoes of shoes.
So much in my voice in Robin Hood, as in my voice as a volunteer bomb, I'm witness with the acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but also with acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have arrived, or they are for achieving remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: don't wait.
They don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get it now.
They serve food in a dining community, clean a neighborhood park.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So you go into the game. You get the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, back.
Mark Bearans: Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks made up in 1868 with a very simple idea, motor modules that fit on each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They've allowed us to build bigger things that we are as buildings or bridges or a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947 to LED came up with this.
He was called automatic assembly slide.
And in a few years, LEDs came to all the home.
It's estimated that more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LED made it accessible.
LED simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce -- the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create a much bigger and more complex circuit -- a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing Liberia.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Limburs are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're ready to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they get together by imaginations.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the sacred, the blue is the current, the pink is the input and the orange color is the algorithm.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly, you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a regulatory.
If we change the button for a pulse model, which is here, and now we have an intellectual light.
And we added this type to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond simple game, Littles are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program and connect and fix -- literatures allow us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make more fast or slower, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind Littles is it's a growing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get rid of their walls to use.
Lights, sound, solar panels, motors -- everything must be accessible.
We've given limits to kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light light works, or why the door of an elevator holds open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken limits to design schools.
So for example, the designers without any experience in electronics start playing with Littles as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and filter, we have George creating George.
(Music sounds)  A few weeks ago, we took Liberia a few weeks ago to the Rhode Island School designers who don't have any experience in engineering alone, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done, an active trusted hut for movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a language made of plastic that is afraid of darkness.
For these no engineers, literally bites became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in reach.
So, Limbatium has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and manufacture them.
We want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and invent it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seek to engage with the environment focusing on the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm. Wait a moment.
You can delay a little bit of card.
We can continue better to leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
solar technology is ...
Oh, already the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and techniques to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that they are supposed to do, and we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called "Congress for America and would be like some of the technical bodies of Peace.
We selected some members every year and we put them to work with the musicians.
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made big applications. They worked with the municipal employees.
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
They know Alan.
This is a city in Boston City.
Here it appears as if I would look for a quote, but what really looks for is that somebody clean it up when it stays through the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he ask for help in this similar way?
Last year in Boston we had a team of community members for America."
They were there in February, and at that time I was born a lot last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these hydrogen.
But one of the members named Erik Michael noticed something else, that citizens cleaned up with the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice app where you can adopt a human.
You accept clean it when you snow.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case I put up.
If you don't do it, someone can robot.
So it's got a playful component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 programmed applications last year.
But it does something that no other government technology does.
And it spreads viral form.
A source of systems from the city of Honolush when you see this application, you realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to adopt stations of tsunami.
It's very important to work these stations of tsunami, but people steal the batteries.
That's why he asks citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens take off the talented speeds.
And Chicago just launched it to get people to record to clean up sidewalks when they snow.
So now we know from nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has spread without fresh, organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology to know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that required three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that it would have done by normal channels that would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the judicial power of California that even the moment has taken 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days and spread viral is a kind of cup of warning.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not like in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Nor as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without restrictions, in open form and generous.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents how to address the issue of the government that has new generation -- not as a problem of an advanced institution but as a problem of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just Congress for America but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute with civic applications every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't complain -- they fix it.
And these people know something that we've lost view.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the DMI arrest automotive -- and all of those other things that get us crazy, the government is essentially in the words of Tim Richard, "What we do together because we don't can."
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to rebuild it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change -- the government is.
And because the government at last end of us -- remember that of us, the people -- the way to think about it affect how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that government is to choose people so that they have charges.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about lanes.
This is the telephone center center of service and information.
It's the place that I think of calls if you mark 311 in America.
Scott caught this call.
I got "Cook in the official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, can you open the door in the house, put very strong music and see if you go?
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the sheets.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app and web and mobile phone, called "The Connection Connection.
We don't program that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New Yorkers of Boston.
One day, this actually happened really, comes this question: "Cartry in my bank capture. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to take it off?
The dynamic of Diannes Connectic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In Diannes Connecticut everything is public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I went on to the place, found the base cube behind the house.
Zarting? Yes. Live? Yes.
I went back to the cube -- I went home.
Good night, sleep sweet."
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physics.
And it's also a great example of government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to be authorized and help others.
So one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
He connected two people.
And it could have connected to the government services of being needed, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the entrance of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that government reflects our values and satisfying our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of 15 inches superior.
On the bottom is what we call burbage.
And we say that word with a lot of waste.
But it's that device that holds that thing that belongs to us as something that is operating in our contract, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sensors.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sensory.
Because that's where the real government work.
We have to collaborate with government machinery.
That makes the Audited movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of concerned citizens who have written a very detailed report of 320 pages in response to the question of the Sergey State of Valley?
That's not political activism -- it's bureaucratic activity.
And for those of us who have respect to government, it's time that we wonder what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in behalf of all?
We can't afford government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand by strengthening civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it knows that it's not so hard to act manufactured, just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to religious, I'm a greater generation than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face who is going to talk, they're all going to speak.
They can express their opinions in any channels at the same time and do it.
So when they face the government problem, they don't care much about making their voices.
They're using hands.
They put hands to work to program applications that make the government better work.
And those applications allow us to use hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a human, taking weeds away, making a garbage cube that has a shop inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up and so many people do it.
But these applications are as digital reminder that we're not only consumers, not only are we consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We're more than that, we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we don't fix the city.
So I want to ask all of the present, when it's about the important things that we have to do together, all together, will we be a volume of voices, or will we be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails and prisons and the death run.
I've spent most of my life in market communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here have impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I mean this because I think identity is really important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach themselves to feel, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, I hear if it's caring, can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an American family dominated by a marriage, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in all discussions in the family.
She started many of the documents in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in the slavery in Virginia, about 1841.
She was born about 1880 and his experience with slavery as he saw the world.
She was hard, but he was also amazing.
When I was a little bit of a look, she was approaching me, and he gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe, and then I was supposed to.
One or two hours later, I went back to look at it, and he approached me and said, "Brish, still feel my agriculture?
And if I said no, I would grab me again, and if I said yes, I left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of the 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went into the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
I thought I was a game.
So he looked at her and smiled, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, and he took me up the room, and he said, "You see Brieve. We are going to convince you.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside, and he said, "Bridge, I'll tell you something, but you can't say to anyone else.
I said, "Okay, Mammoth."
She said, "Now I'm glad you won't have it." I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know I've been watching you."
And he said, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do whatever you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to promise three things, Brazi.
I said, "You know, Mammoth."
And he said, "The first thing I want you to promise me is you always want your mother."
Audience: "She is my daughter, and you have to promise me to always take care of it."
As I loved my mom, I said, "Yes, Mama, so I'll do it."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to promise me is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is the difficult thing.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, Mammot. So I'll do it."
Then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to promise me is you never drink alcohol."
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Mama, so I'll do it."
I grew up in the field, in the rural South, I have a brother a year old and a single year a year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a six beer package -- I don't know where I took them, and I would grab my sister and me and went for the forest.
We just got to do the usual laws.
He took a beer supply, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's good. You follow you, but I'm not going to take beer.
My brother said, "Come on. And you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister also takes a beauty."
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can follow.
Then my brother looked at me.
He said, "What happens? Take a celebrity."
I took a look at it with strength and said, "Oh, I'm not going to be thinking about the conversation with Mamada."
I said, "But what are you talking about?
He said, "Mammoth tells all the grandchildren that are special.
I was deliberate.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is going to be excited.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a virtue. I say it because of the power that the identity is.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really see them sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prime during the ban of proposition.
My uncle died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to commit them.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in a criminal freedom.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor or black communities, it finds so much defender, so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black blacks between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or in condition.
In urban communities all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, from 50 to 60 to 60 percent of all of the young color people are in prison or in condition.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that is a lot better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not cultural, but wealth.
And it seems that we feel very quiet.
The politics of fear and water makes us believe that these are not problems.
We're disconnected.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you give you from right forever, if you have a criminal condition.
Right now in Alabama, 34 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years the level of rights to be as thin as it was before they approved the law of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it feels 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no possibility to go out.
Right now we're in the process of some literature.
The only country in the world.
I represent people in the death run.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, they have taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for crimes that are done?
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way to look at it, it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for the crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
In every nine executed people, it's identified one that is innocent that is extended and released from the death row.
A mistake of error, amazing, an innocent from every nine.
This is interesting.
It would be not allowed to be able to have no planes if every nine you would expect, you would be starved.
But we sort of isolate the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with African history, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that I started at the end of the rebuilding and it lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid of being limited.
They worried about being bounced.
The threat of the terror was what he defined his lives.
Now there are older people who are approaching me, and they say, "Mr. Steven, you tell talks, do speeches -- I give people to stop saying that in our history we read for the first time with terrorism, after 111."
They ask me to say, "No, say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial supply and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what historically we've done.
All the time we hit each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races, I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real and reconciliation process.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome racial segregation without the truth and the reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures about death penalty conference.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's okay to hear what you say.
Abanian: "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will naturally never be able to get it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intellectual and deliberately we could run people."
So reflect about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would run to people, especially if they were mostly Jewish?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational being.
And yet, there is this device.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you actually don't care about these very difficult issues, positive things are -- yet they are involved with it.
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. We love creativity.
We love entertainment.
But finally, those realities are removed by suffering, abuse abuse, degradation.
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
We finally talk about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the feathers, the ones that will never come to TED.
To think about them is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are -- despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, the development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from food to the heart conventions as well.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not only the brilliant and deliberate but also in the dark and the difficult.
Valzon Hawaii, the great dairy leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering the oppression -- we had all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in design sites and being teeth."
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, that still in communities like TED, has to engage us.
There is no disconnect to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to explorer, to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We will find them.
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa Parks.
These women are just meeting just to speak.
Occasionally, Mr. Car called me, to say, "Britain, come the Mrs. Parks. We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and listen to it?
I said, "Yes, lady. I want to."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come from?"
And I said, "Let's hear you."
So I went and just listened to them.
It was a very clever thing, very lighting.
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these ladies and after a couple of hours, Dr. Parks went to me and said, "Now Brieve, tell me that it's that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice management.
We tried to end with the sensors of life, without confidence for children.
We tried to do something about the death penalty of death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the massive landscapes."
I gave all my best speech, and then I looked at me and he looked at me, and he said, "You know, Mmm mile mile."
And I added about, "Let's end up advanced, very standing."
At that time, Ms. Car leaned up, put his finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very very valuable."
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to figure out how to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst that we have made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not that it's a land.
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a killer.
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be respected by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic. Very beautiful, very silent, very stimulating, will not judge us by our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual or rational capacity.
At the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful and privileged but the way they treat the poor, the conferences, the press.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand things really profound about what we are.
Sometimes I feel happy. I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
It was tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been feeling very sweet.
I go to prison, and I see my 13-year-old customers who have been traveling to them as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it isn't it?
The judge took it as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night I was awake. For God, if the judge can become something that you are not, you must have magical powers.
Yes, Brieve, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think properly, but I started working on a movement.
I had a 14 year-old customer -- a small one, poor, black.
I started working in the monitor, with a training that said, "Manage so that my bottle black client is treated as a permanent white white white white white white white.
In the music I had that had been embedded in the accumulation, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was an attractive line about how in this country there is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that inspiring music would be a dream or really write it?
For my horror, not only had it reduced it, but he had sent it to the court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally decided, "Oh God, I have to go to court for this stupid case.
I jumped into the car and I felt really advantage, overwhelmed.
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and loss.
I finally left the car. He walked to court.
I was climbing the stairs when I met with a bigger black man -- it was the come of the judgment.
When he saw me, he approached me, and he said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a lawyer? He said, "Is you a lawyer, I said yes.
So I was approached and added me.
And I'm whispering in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was very very very very smart.
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Steven, you wrote this both morality of monitor?
I said, "Yes, Mr. I was me? And we started to argue.
People started to go. They were all indicated.
I was the one who had written those crazy madness.
They came to the police photographs the headlines, the automatic.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all of them work because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the robot of the eye I went to see the sign that went and came.
I looked at the window, and I was going to hear all that scream.
I kept walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with face of concern, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the label table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge described a resistance.
During the descendant a sense of the answer was speaked because he had entered the room.
The assistant.
And he said, "Hmm, what do you do in the audience room.
And the old black stood up, looked at the sensation, looked at me and said, "I got this audience room to tell this young man who keeps his view in the goal with particle."
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we can't truly be evolved if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must lead to the fragiles, compassion and justice.
And above all, those of those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view in the target.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an age of the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a crash. What can we do?
BG: There are several opportunities close to them.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a referendum of this spring in which an effort will be made to represent the funds that are spent today in punishment policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty in the next five years.
And despite this, 46 percent of the cases of homicide don't include risks.
Six percent of the rapes don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This refugee is going to propose that these funds are going to be given to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge decline in crime in the U.S., in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is that it has to do with the largest incarceration rate.
What would you say to those who think it is?
BG: Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase comes into the prison population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into a perpetual chain, for stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against property instead of making those resources back to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Brink, you have excited.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter Diamonds, these are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- they would probably be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the means of press prefer to provide us negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second in every day, our senses get much more data than probably the brain can probably process.
And as nothing matters us more than survive, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called a female.
And the amygdala is our early warning detector -- the danger detector.
I order and record all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a dozen stories we will prefer to look at the negative.
That old thing about the press, "If there's blood -- selling -- it's very true.
And because all digital devices provide us negative news seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, is not to miss that we are passionate.
It's not surprising that people think the world goes out of bad in worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is that we get distances.
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is accelerating. We have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, climate change, species of species and water and energy. We don't have it.
As human beings are very good at advising problems and, in the long time, we ended up with them.
We analyzed it in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than doubled -- the average income per capita per capita per capita has tripled around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communication, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinkel showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kenya was 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to get higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, reports, television, mobile air and cars.
The barbarian markets of the last century, the empathy of the planet, would never have dreamed with such luxury.
Support a lot of this is technology and, finally, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that comes in the information technology jumped on this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the performance of price in about 12 to 24 months.
For that reason, the mobile phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a 1930s supercomputer.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recent and a research.
It's the result of fast computers used to build more fast computers.
It doesn't stop before any big challenges.
And even though it's graduated on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast.
And in this curve, the Moore's Law markets, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends in Australia called infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuels, vaccines and food, digital medicine, nature and A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" from Waterthy, from IBM:
It was painting.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline I had.
And I loved this: "Wats come to human opposites."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
I play with the magic of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called Silicon University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can potentially affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have sounded advanced.
Today we can point out a dozen companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create fancy life for every single standard on the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that stuff that is scarce, and I'll get it down.
You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Nakay II in the middle of 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited to dinner the king of Simmer.
The Nake troops ate with plate covered and the same Nakeling, with gold covers with gold.
But the king of Simmer, he ate with aluminum covered together.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it goes more than the gold and the platform.
That's why the tip of the Montana to Washington is alternative.
You see, although aluminum is 31 percent of the Earth's mass, it doesn't come as a pure metal metal.
It's linked by oxygen and silence.
But then they got the electron and made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was destroyed.
We project this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 minutes.
It's not about scanner, but accessible.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generation per data, 880 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, the solar electricity cost six cents per hour per hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have an abundance of energy, we also have water abundance too.
Let's talk now about war war.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan, put the Voyager spacecraft on the Earth, in 1990, after Saturn country?
So I took a famous picture. How did it call it?
"A pale blue point."
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet in 70 percent per water.
Yes, 97 percent is water, two percent is ice, and we fight by five percent of the water on the planet, but here's an hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, nature.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the virus -- I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to do it, his technology called Slops -- you know, it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of clean water on the day of any source water, contaminated water, a letter -- for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coke just agreed to make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes right, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in 20 countries on the planet.
This is an innovation that is involved by this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in the mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for 2013.
Think about it, that mass warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with an intelligent cell with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- GPS, HIV, images, books of books and music, medical diagnostic technology -- now they're demonstrating and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes when the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Mullin Foundation, something called the X Calleton Calter Calter, 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device with which they talk about, and because it has A.I. they can take blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnosis.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the market charge is 25 percent and there are 1.3 percent workers of health.
When this device sequence a virus of RNA or DNA that doesn't recognize -- call the power of health and, first of all, avoid the pandemic happening.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion.
The white lines here are the population.
We just spent the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to bring the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users on the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you get to the global conversation.
What do these people want?
What do you want to do? What do you want to do?
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars embedded in the global economy.
And they will get more health from the Scratch, from a better education with Academy Khan and because of the use of 3D printing and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy and productive health?
How about a few voices never be before?
What if we give them the oppositions, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What will these 3,000 billion do?
What if they're contributions that we can't predict in?
Something that I learned with the X Prize is that small teams -- guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things, things that before they could only do big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called Pole.
He came up at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino amino and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine structure and function.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a supercomputer problem.
They've played with this college teachers, among others.
And then hundreds of thousands of people were succeeded and started playing it.
And it's shown that today's recognition machinery is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that today we have more power as people to assume the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation of the visual.
We have the capital of the television.
And we have three billion new minds to join us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
The price of the point of particular.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1836.
You may believe that I would be paining, but it wasn't like that.
You actually collect fish.
And he described one of them as very common."
It was the brain.
He took it very much to the 1880s.
Now the fish is on the Red River of US.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're present.
The pictures still say they remain intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept. The shift of the waist.
Because I was there in 1974.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be interrupted.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The language was surrounded by palms, and as you can see, from some manual.
There were the telescopes of about 20 centimeters -- the black bar thylacine telephone.
And the fish of this thylacine was very abundant and it was going on for a good moment, so it won more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down to half.
They killed five centimeters at five.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was involved in the introduction of the highway fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, we started in the 1960s -- Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was supposed to impose the countries that already had 100,000 fishermen -- to impose industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly, was called the Murrate Four.
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in the southern China Sea and, especially in the Jane Sea.
What we captured is something intelligent.
We captured now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were shops, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most fish are tiny stands on a few rests, remains that are fish of coral reefs.
In short, the sea bottom came to the cover and then it was ran.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom goes from being a solid coral background, in this case, to be a legal.
This is a dead tool.
They didn't eat them. They were destroyed because they were dead.
Once we captured a living.
I was still not harmful.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect every time they go to an area where they never fish.
But it doesn't be documented by it.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the point of particle, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this something like this.
On the axis -- and we have good things -- biodiversity -- amount of boxes, the brain supply, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and the extraordinary forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they didn't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the waste of changes.
And at the end of the end keeping a few rest of them.
And that, in great measure, we want to do this now.
We want to keep things that are no longer or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant before extinction is very common.
You don't lose any abundant animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become a little bit frequent because we fished them.
And over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of particle.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, questioning that it was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the present -- like captured such that they capture a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or usually not using the scientists of fish because it's not scientific."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we live in instrumental societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
So the huge role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with protected marine areas, we really recreated the past.
We remember the past that people can't conceive because the score point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they provide -- which allows them to erase their baseline.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access like the Middle West, for example, for example?
I think there are the arts and the cinema maybe they can fill the vacuum.
This is a silence of the Chapter Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in Chasela Bay, 500 years ago.
And you have noticed that the mathematicians and the turns are like "Alive."
And if you think about "About "About "About "What if you think about why people moved to the film -- not talking about the history of Phones, why would you be able to get to compare with images?
Because it makes something that, in a sense, has been lost.
That's why my recommendation -- the only one that will give, is Cambridge, make "Arabic I"sk under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin Ladification, the U.K. trend manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why video videos are made and how important it is.
We all want to be stars, celebratory, containers, commands -- when I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper news in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a sand.
More than 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And from that, only a small percentage is made viral -- it gets a vision of vision and a cultural momentum.
How does that happen?
Three things: trends of trends and supermarket communities and surprise.
Well, let's start with.
Berkeley Valleys, oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow.
Ohland, wood."
KA: Last year, Berkeley Victorian published this filmed video outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproduction in the popularity of last summer.
Berkeley is not supposed to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you're called Mosomoth Mountain Berkeley.
I had published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimming.
Jimmy Kimming published this tweet that would cut the video to the population.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kim presented us things new and interesting and moving them into a wider audience.
Rebel Blue,  It's Friday, Friday, you have to start the Friday --   everybody wants to get the end of the week, the weekend of week.   Lives, Friday -- starting the Friday --  KA: Don't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
"Revolution "Lines Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like "Archaic written Diego -- this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other peaks as well, they're also Friday, too.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday past?
Well, the Toyota took and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Mister Science There, was one of the first people in making a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends of trends will adopt a point of view and share it with a wider audience, speed up the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 parks of "German Venezuelas in YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other day.
Unlike the global entertainment of the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the phenomenon by explaining it or doing something new with that.
"No Carter is a representative animation with an agreed music.
So that's it. That's it.
And this year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a three hours version that has seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet technology community.
There were stars.
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, a whole community of remix that made this happen from being a stupid joke to something that we can all form part.
Because we don't just enjoy, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted "Rich River Drum or Rebel Black or "Dan Carl?
What did you mean might have written this situation to us?
In a world where two days of video is coming up for minute, only that really unique and unexpected can spread out how these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy who protest the mouse metaphors in New York City, I admit that I don't get interested in me.
Casey Steven: I was multiply by not circular by the biological but often there are obstacles that prevent you right through the bicycle.
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and your humor, Casey Stevensons came up with five million watched and understood your idea.
So this approach is worth for all of the new things that we do.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
Berkeley Valleys. What does this mean?
Oh okay.
KA: What does this mean?
The trend of trends -- creative communities of participation -- totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Bank, started in YouTube.
They didn't use permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little hero of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, which is just the middle media, but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still broken.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece -- a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a drug, a man whose entire life had supported in the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
Imagine as the communities go into Santa, affecting the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, now they full it.
It was reflected in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in arena, and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to expand us, but we supported it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat when you love it to simply slow into the sea.
My mother, Mad, was just 18 when his father died, and a concentrated marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had spread to a task alone, the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inclusively for her who couldn't do it.
And after a four year-old sand that challenges the fiction, a boat was shown to the search sea of fishing boat.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was pilots, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother took a standard with poison.
If you were captured, first of all, you would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the proper shop in every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirate pictures that came several times, but they were trained with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and couldn't run for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and to the young man who collapsed and died, ending the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given by the men's men.
No apple had the same support.
After three months in a refugee camp, we would go in Melbudwes.
And the next piece of puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in Depression, a kind of climbing suburban whose population is made of immigrants.
Unlike the middle class suburbs -- whose existence I met, in Democratic had no sense of the right.
The smells that come from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the friends of buried English were embedded between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a line of cars, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT technology.
We were poor.
All the dollars were set up, and it established an extra tube in English and mathematics, no matter what you should be shot, which was usually new clothes, always a second hand.
Two media pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the towers, because I had to last six years.
And there were a little bit of weird and painful singing sides and some graphics, "Asia, go home."
home. Where?
Something in me was entertained.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to get you."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted, but we told us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered pen, all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmare would start to wake up.
She opened a computer store, then he studied to be a statistical and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry, and influence, and armed kids trapped between two worlds.
Subjects and patterns.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic Asian student -- it was implicit with what I stopped myself.
In the other, I was locked in precise lives, tragic ladies by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many received help over the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer, I was picked up the young Australian young year.
And I was captured from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit down.
And so I read -- I read an anonymous Fordies of Depression, it was now so Legis, refugees and social activist, invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of name, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the crops.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to give back to the routine and the comfort of life in an ignored suburban -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling you about the day of each and getting asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had the same age that she had when we went on the boat.
No ever was an option.
"Hey, he said, "And you don't know what you're not."
So I talked about juvenile and education and density to the markets and the destructions.
And the more frankly, the more I talked about, the more it was applied to speak.
I met people from all walks of life, many of them doing what they love, living in the border of the possible.
And although I finished my literature, I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a recent one, new on the scene -- and not only is it good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean to collect the horizon, it can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your proposition.
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world is demonstrated, but not the way we fear.
Possibilities that wouldn't have been allowed to be extremely failed.
There was an energy there, an implanted optimism and a real mixture of humility and warming.
So I kept my intuition.
I put together a little group of people who the motto can't do -- it was a critical challenge.
For a year we didn't have a center.
At the end of every day, I did a giant soup of soup that we all share.
We worked until the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened step.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My cards again.
Three months later, I had moved to me, and the adventure went on.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the Congo was the social norm and the local Mandela was the person that matters.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew it alone.
At 17 became a conference of a Mandela whose mother beat it.
No support of his husband, he caused a revolution to demand it and take the cause herself and much more back when he won.
It can't be able to be mean.
I was in the shower at the room of a hotel in Sydney when she died -- about 1,000 miles in Melbudwes.
I looked through the market mammoth and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew he had come to me.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Decemenus, and we sat around his attack.
We told stories and we make sure we were still with it.
At night a monkey came and told us he had to close the attack.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monkey, "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold?
"Because you've taken your hand from the morning, he said.
"You haven't sold it."
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life formed us, we can now see that the men who had reached our lives would have frustrated us.
The defeat would have easily agreed.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for you?
Yet, I fear the privilege of how easy the right.
Can I give you a test in your lives, getting brave in every wave, the conservative pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and look at it, I would do it.
Tree Nepala and also the mother of so is here today in the room or fifth line.
My story begins in Rardon about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the startling sky, with the singing subsidies Muslim Alan.
We were talking about how nothing has changed since the ancient time of the old Indian epidemic "The Malahi."
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and we suggested the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was arrested, the great Indian warrior war was sending, I had a sheet, he pulled a bow and a flower on the floor, it gets water.
Now we do the same with the talks and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced magic.
And that was a lot.
I felt a little more television.
I was terrified by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate an Oscar if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't treat my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to enable magic, not killing it.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his choose silver climber.
And this technology piece of 50 years was for me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, and paradigms and nature in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones, the luxury clock, and the cameras prevent that we are.
They were slow our inspiration.
So I launched -- I was reminded to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic instead of killing magic.
It illustrates books since the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
To bring the text to the image, animation and sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly multiple.
But what does that mean?
I'm about to launch Khon, an interactive application for iPad.
He says, "Collect your fingers on every light.
And so --   He says, "This box belongs -- I write my name.
And so I become a character of the book.
In several moments, I get a letter -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and drugs but to that magic of childhood, those ideas we open from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always assumption.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad.
And they actually illuminate your way in which it comes out of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy was in a ball.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a ball that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all the fantasy books there have always been maps but they have been static maps.
This is a map that grows and fitted and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it also reveals it.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and as a contemporary time.
These are the shops here.
You've all heard of the tasks and the nines, but how many people outside of India know their Indian contracts, you know?
So these poor parts have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old book and called book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary child history.
In a story that takes current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been buried, attached to their P.C. -- they haven't gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out on the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections.
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this ritual of childhood, you have to go out, and in a chapter take a picture to a flower and then label it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then label it.
So you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a rock and says, "Oh, I saw a room."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey."
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking out.
In the connections of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we tend to have an interaction in which you get out with the iPad, and the video fires and through augmented reality, you see a group of animated commands that appear on the interior plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and fly them to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where nature forces are intertwined with technology and magic and technology and technology will be closer to each other.
We leverage the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic and joy and child love that we feel through a simple story.
Thank you.
So I'd like to talk to you about why many aid projects fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of Robert was to give a director of listening.
And not a very scientific way, she had a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family and known, what happens?
"How can we help it?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the aid projects fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wikipedia bush. It's very simple.
It's got a pollution and shooting off.
All tomorrow.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to reach up to 95 Kield.
But it's so simple, every time I connect me, I send my information to Google Health.
And my medical doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when I need cancer assistance.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wikipedia for Wikipedia, and before I go up to my car, people start to talk to me: Luck, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people out of their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more health control.
The next week being available.
This little bit connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people will be able to be able to be able to take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to the control and to be captain of their own ship, but it can also help us the care of health because of the challenges that we face, as the show of the costs of medical attention, the democratization of demand and other issues.
It will take techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by crowd.
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in cars.
Maybe we have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the automatic characters are in Masana.
And also where the gas are all about.
And of course, we can find fast food chain.
But where is the nearest DNA to help this patient?
We asked but no one did.
Nobody knew where to get DNA saved lives right now.
What we did was we made crowd in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to say, you see a DNA, please send it, give you a decade where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open in office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 DNA is already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for Launa, augmented reality, to find these DNA.
And every time they are in the city of Massachusett, and someone collapsed, they can use their iPhone, and the next weeks use their microscope from Microsoft to find the nearest DETI, which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like DNA 41, which is the name of the product, but also as A Statement.
And we would want to start in a global level.
We're constructing all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work and act as a center for the democratic of DNA around the world.
Every time they are from vacation and someone collectively, it can be a relatives or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us value these DNA.
It could be messages of messages or phone people, for example, to see if the DNA that shows is still in their place.
Please help you and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it the photograph?
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15.
It mixed with my previous passion for drawing but it was a little different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when you press your puppet.
For me the photograph had more than to see with being in the right place, at the point of time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the publish.
pictures like this: a building in a very transparent road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite that, it keeps a level of reality.
Or pictures like this, dark and colorful at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of reality.
And when I say reality I say photographers.
Because, of course, it's not something that I can capture but I always want it to seem to be captured somehow as a photograph.
photos where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that will capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real, right?
Are the details or the colors?
Do you intervene the light?
What does the illusion create is?
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginative objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems three-dimensional as if it exists.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So we deceive the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're the ones we don't even think, the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But when you combine photographs is very important to consider it, because something else is going wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures should have the same perspective.
Second, combined pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images come up with these requirements, they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of different images with a perfect unit.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
This is another example.
I might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is manipulated.
But this picture is totally composed by photographs of different places.
In fact, I think it's easier to create a place than finding it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The costs are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a point of stone.
And yes, I even did the house of the top of the island so that it seems more Sweden.
So to get a realistic result, I think it takes planning for planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well thought.
If you do a good job when you take the pictures, the result can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there, and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it up.
It's a diagram that I took from a folder.
I'm not interested in just showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of RISA versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this is, like many other things that we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
Speaking of technology with sexual curves is something new.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please get the lights up.
It would need more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we make technological curves on lawyer scales?
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where we say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to chart -- the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if a graph, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a sexual curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology will move as fast as microscope, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move to that rhythm.
There are no precedent in the history of the technological development of a reminded growth that every few years forward orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- looking at these exponential curves -- we see that they don't get forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve I know like this until something completely different, or maybe do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we're in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask is, what is that new way to adopt the world?
What do the world goes on?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're embedded in it.
I remember the future in 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been accepted, year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extracting what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition that we experience are.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and I.T.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at the long term.
The time scale I would like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we went back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with many chemicals that float around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals were organized we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and it is, at that time, I had floating an oil droplet with all kinds of chemical recipes inside of it.
Some of those oil droplet contain a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside, and so the droplets grew up.
And they started to divide.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell shapes, those oil motors.
But those guns were not alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they divide them into a distinctive distribution of chemicals that they have.
So every single engine was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow differ to be better at the time to incorporate the surrounding chemicals -- they grow more, they grew more chemicals and divide more.
They generally lived longer. They were more represented.
It was a form of life, chemistry life, very simple, but things became interesting when these guys learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand these blobs very well learned to store information.
They learned to supply information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they worked in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to replicate it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living will be expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun. Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 white dust microbes that try to hide people in the security of the airport.
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this DNA fragment and I took it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all of the present, in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a blog I would have put it in a virus and I would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step here?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy for another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different and was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming this cell community.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and put them together to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many residents to the penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in a way, were together in that, and they set up a synthetic.
That way they survive or fail together, which is that if a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community were replicate more and were fascinated by evolution.
And the point of inflection happened when these communities came so far that, in fact, they joined and decided to write all the recipe of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have molecular communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism alone.
In fact, we are a molecular community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscle of the muscle, or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began to absorb information.
And building very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities build.
In fact, they began to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to record and understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as individuals, learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and was sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these data processing structures that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals eating that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures enormously accelerating the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now occur to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a vague idea, in your head.
I'm here sitting here emitting a bunch of groups, and hopefully building a similar idea, vaginal and confused, in your heads that hold certain analogy with me.
But we take something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound sequences and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work like an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we have started to perform abstract.
Now we go through periods similar to the molecular organisms, we embrace our methods of records and presentation and information processing.
For example, language invention was a little step in that direction.
The television, the computer, the video tape, the CO2, and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that makes us a much bigger thing, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds now.
You already saw the evolutionary example of you in which I produced some evolution with the conventional program, in our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scale of time again.
The first stages of history that I told you about a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next ones -- the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And the next ones like electronics, it seems just a few decades.
The process gets feedback, I guess authority is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we look at in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process represented.
But I gave my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I work to design them would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know it does every transistor in that computer machine.
There are billions of millions.
Instead, with the designers of The Titanic Machines, we think of a level of abstraction -- we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you could not be able to do, much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes I employ methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microscopes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We said, "Please, you can run a hundred million sequence of instructions of the supermarket?
Can you run these sequences of instructions at random, run all those programs, and take those who are more approaching what we want to do?
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, ordered numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could put two numbers in the right order.
And I said, computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task better?
Let's take those and we remove the rest of them.
And now we get the ones that better ordered the numbers.
And we go back to play them following a process of announcing analysis to sex."
Let's take two programs that are going to get shortles, and that children will inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of products of programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the process."
California again.
I put some mutations into it.
And it tries again and represent it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few millions.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that order absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they turn the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depended on doing it.
Once I was in a 747 with Martin Ministers, and he pulled a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "This plane has hundreds of thousands of parts working together to offer a safe flight. Don't make you feel a crucking floor?
And we know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than produces normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so can be able to execute these programs much more quickly.
You know, it was removed.
The thing goes faster and faster, and so I think it seems so confused.
Because all these technologies are replacing it.
We're going on.
And we're at an analog moment in the world organisms when they became multiple.
We are the emails and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it comes from.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get rid of it.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that should change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've run enough time to allow me to yield part of my false prisoner in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World series.
We love baseball. Right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's just to go out and "Start the rules and talk about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know it.
It's called the battle average.
And we talked about 300 of a battery that battery.
That means that the basis is even extremely, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being caught up, and anyone who tries to launch it into the first base, doesn't get to time, and the second base will be saved.
Three attempts from 10.
Do you know how you call a 300 back in the Great Legos?
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a 400 baseball bag of 400 bikes?
By the way, that is somebody who is 10 balls, is about four.
Leonardo -- like reading Ted Williams, the last player of the Great League of Biosphere to execute more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's bring this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have applications, and they're dedicated to a surgeon that has also a 400 record in applications.
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a loved self has two survival coronary arteries and their family doctor brought it to a cardiologist whose record in angiogenesis is 200 percent.
But do you know anything?
She's getting this year.
And they have been 257.
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask them.
What do you think that should be the average of a heart surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon, or a nurse or a manipulation object?
1900, very good.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the medicine knows the features of a good surgeon or a doctor or a paradigm.
What we do, though, is to send them to the world, and I include it, with the heart of being perfect.
That never, they make a mistake and worry about finding out how to do well.
That was the message I added when I was in medical school.
I was a complicated complex student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Global studied until a blood test.
And so on.
I studied in my little desert, in the residence of the General hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy member, memory and muscle work, the branching of every artery that comes out of the top, the digital digital diagnosis and the subsidic.
And even I knew the digital diagnosis about how to classify kidney academic activities.
And as much as I took more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated with honor.
And the school edges of medicine with the impression that if I memorize everything, then I would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because this is what I'm going to get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the Drugmard Shri.
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when I brought to the Drugmard lady to the emergency service where I was working.
At that moment I was assigned to the cardiology service.
And when I used to be able to get a card to a cardiologist I got to attend to that patient.
And you get into the head of residents.
When I saw Dr. Durabia, I was slide.
I heard a solid sound.
And when I got it, I heard a sandard sound in both sides, which gave me a conscious heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pumping blood forward, blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose it.
I did it and I went to work in the treatment that I would give him.
I gave him counseling and medication to relieve pressure in his heart.
I gave him diagrams, water pills.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I took the first mistake -- he sent it home.
It actually took two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't raise the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and consume it with him for her to see.
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring complex information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that requires constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility -- that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, he didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner who said, "Gold, it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse to take care of Mrs. Durable, "Do you think it's okay if you go to your house?
And the nurse thought and then he said with total nature, "Yes, I think I'll be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the height, and the ambulance along with the pictures took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad presence in the stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I started to leave the hospital and walked into the parking parking where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something that I don't normally do.
I went home for the emergency service service.
And there another nurse, not the one I care about Mr. Durabia before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors fear of.
Other specialists are afraid of it, but there's a particle in an emergency and is that we see the patients.
The three words are: Do you remember you?
"Do you remember the patient I sent to your house?
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
"Well, she got back, with the same voice tone of voice.
She was fine.
But it comes back and on the verge of death.
In the course of an hour of having arrived at his house, after I was given the high, he suffered a collaborator and his family called 9/11. The paradises brought it to emergency with an artificial pressure of 50 millimeters from Hello, which means a severe shop.
Just breathing and was blue.
The emergency staff sponsors all their resources.
They gave him medication to climb the blood pressure.
They put an artificial response.
I was concerned and happened to the spinal cord.
I had a sense of feelings because after the stabilize was in intensive therapy and I was hoping against all hope that would be recovered.
And in the two or three days it was obvious that I would never wake up.
I had a critical brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were resident to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let them go. Drug Druggili, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next week, I kept myself for it, and I experienced for the first time the evil shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt just a little isolated.
You make the countries and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves an teaching.
The evil shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt like.
And it wasn't my boss, he was a love.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I survived things and I make sure that they didn't get me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss? Why did I send it to her house?
And in my worst moments, why did I make a mistake so stupid?
Why did I choose medicine?
Little for that feeling was disability.
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, I opened up the sky and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I cut the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And so it was.
I went back to work.
But it went back.
Two years later, I was help in the emergency department in a community north of Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the garden.
I was very busy and spending.
And he was sitting here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little colored.
He sent him penicillin, and he sent him home.
But while he turned to the door kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guardian change, my boss asked to talk to me quiet in his office.
And I came up with the three words, OK?
Remember the patient that he saw for a pain in the garden?
And he came back and didn't have a sterence farming.
I had a potentially fatal reaction called photos.
You can look for Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but the top area, and that can cause the heart of those tracks.
He, fortunately, didn't fail.
And you get anti-called antibiotics and recover the few days.
And you go through the same period of shame and reproduction, then I encouraged me and went back to work, until again and again, and again.
Two times in the same emergency turn, not disappearing applications.
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it fits 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a discovery.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They order a radio of rions, but it turned out, a colleague that was checking the patient perceived a certain sensitivity on the lower right square and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid to render and asked my colleague to make it.
I checked it up, and when I noticed some sensitivity in the lower right-hand side, I called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every single case, I was delivered.
But I'd like to tell you that I took the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a bottle.
The most significant people have been over the last five years.
Only and advanced and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't release and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my colleagues.
How do you teach them that they don't make the same mistakes?
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure.
Of course, in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't listen to someone talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a trauma in my hospital took the wrong leg -- believe me that it would have difficulty to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions, which make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and those who are -- the ones that have a result and those who have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if we move from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will stay safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of distribution and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical practices and doctors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Star Stanford to my program, White Country, Black Art white art -- black art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are numbers.
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 prescribed drugs in the hospital are wrong, or discussion is not correct. In a system where international infections are increasingly more, and more numbers, providing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 channels die for prevalent medical mistakes.
The U.S. Institute of America established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's all about gross subsidies, because we're not despite the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiplied every two or three years, and we don't update us.
The prison of sleep.
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect story of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, and it comes to local eyes with closed eyes, and all of a sudden, my story is about desert.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot. I don't do things always as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't relate their symptoms as always the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all the professional properties to error, well, not to stay anybody.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their more serious cases?
In my program, white Delishman, black art -- it's a consumption to say, "This is my worst mistake? I would tell everybody, from the schools to the head of heart surgery, "This is my worst mistake," blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah -- and driving the microphone towards them.
And their students would stop, they would go back, they would turn their head and they would walk out and they would start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake."
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a radical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The reduction doctor is human, you know human, you accept it, and it's not intrigued from its mistakes, but it is effort to learn what happened to teach others.
They share their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It pointed out the mistakes of other people not with the intention of catching them, but in a loving and support way for everybody to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings will lead the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time in time.
My name is Brian Globala.
I'm a redefine doctor.
I'm human.
And I feel so much, but I strive to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words, I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions do you take a day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to choose an average American, are about 70 a day.
Not much ago, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies of companies.
The researchers record the different tasks by these executives and the time they used to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, in average, 30 jobs they found a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of ministers.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
You know how many of you belong to nine minutes, and how many of you at one hour one?
How do you calculate the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems in today's community, choosing the option of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, you raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a palm.
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the problem of option survival?
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I found this very, very high level of level -- at least at that time it was very sophisticated.
It was called Drawing.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and village, over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water embarrassed, and this was when we took water water.
I loved going to that store, but in one occasion, he asked me, why never buy anything?
This is the standard of the olive oil.
They had more than 75 different kinds of different classes including those who were in the sealed box that came from military trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "Do you work this strategy of offering all these options?
He pointed up the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the memories.
Happy.
They had 330 different classes.
We installed a set of support, just to the entrance of the store.
We put out of six supply supply, or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop the measurement?
More people were stopped when there was 24 -- 60 percent, that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a market of memory.
Here we find the opposite effect.
The ones who stopped when there was 24 -- only three percent came to buy message.
The ones they stopped when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought message.
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy the memory if they found six -- that if they found 24.
Well, to decide that we don't buy a lot of it is probably coming to us -- at least it is good to preserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of the survival of choice affects us into crucial decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this doesn't convince us.
Now the issue of the day, financial savings.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with Guit Haven, and I would start Kamigab and Wink Jane, where we looked at the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 600 plans in this country.
We were interested to see if the number of funding supply plants available into subjective savings for retirement savings -- the 404 program -- demonstrated people to save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a correlation there.
We had 650 plans that were going from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding forests, there was less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the participation rate was 70 percent or more, not as high as you will.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of options, the more people were inclined by avoiding actions or investment funds.
As much as there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would recommend to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they put the decision, which is when it goes against the interest of the interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and in health.
They're more likely to pick up less satisfying things, even though they often give them better.
The main reason is that we manage to look at that giant variety of May, mustard and vehicle and mercine, but we're not able to do the calculations to compare and contract and choose from that awesome exhibition.
Today I want to propose to you today four simple techniques that we have experienced, in one form or another, in different research, so that they can rehearse in their business.
The first is, Cortex.
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People always bother when I say, "Copyrance."
They care about losing space in the angle.
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut, you want to get rid of strange redundant options, there will be an increase in the sales -- you'll go down the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When Project & Gamble went from 26 different types of Health or Solo to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Goldman Park corporation eliminated the products for shelters that are less sold -- they increased the users in 87 percent, by two causes.
You know that the supermarket today, in average offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is Alban and it offers only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the plant, David Liberans, the Harvard program.
All Harvard employees are automatically incompatible to a life insurance fund.
Those who really want to choose -- they offer them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, people say, "I don't know how to cut up.
These are all important options.
The first thing I do is ask the employees, tell me the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't differentiate -- you can't do their clients."
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to Garban.
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience a few holidays with everything paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a description here.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give an applause if you're ready to take the Garden supply.
(Audience speeches: Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
Not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I actually managed to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, than in the second, but I can get advantage and say they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to manage the problem of the choice survival, which is Confusion.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that consequences must feel very visible, very concerned.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more in average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use defection?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Shoot Benjamin and Alexander Prince, on the staff of Indian Indian personality that worked in INCR: these people were in a meeting in which they were applied to a 404 plan.
And that meeting that we were looking at exactly as a underground, we made a little addiction.
What we added was that we requested the staff to think about positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving more money.
And with this minute there was an increase in the reports of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their savings account of savings from four percent.
The third technique is Clapt.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in the Womenhy supported throughout the edge of the edge, the magazines exhibit can contain from 330 different types to 66.
But you know?
Because the legislation tells me how to tell you.
These are two jets of jewelry.
One is called "Japan and the other, "Steak."
If you think the one on the left is Santa and the one on the right is Japan, they give a palm.
(Chicken speeches: Well, there are some people.
If you think the one on the left is Japan and the one on the right is Switzerland, they give a palm.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Japan and the one on the right is Santa. But you know something?
This claim of rating is totally useless.
categories have to indicate something to whom you choose -- not that you define them.
You often look at this problem with those huge fundraising.
allegedly who are you driving?
My fourth category -- will drive complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very complicated decision, the buy of a car.
This is an German manufacturer of cars that allow them to get it completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to draw your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one.
colors, outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
(Motor championship, four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many options, 56 colors to a few boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, four boxes, to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to do?
How involved you are.
If it's always acting the button for the effect in every decision, this indicates that they're overwhelmed or is, we're losing them.
We found that the ones that go from many choices to a few other choices -- open the button, again and again, and another one.
We lose them.
If you go from a few choices to many, you continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was you disrupt the order in which the information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to pick up.
Although you choose the box of change that doesn't say anything about the preferences of inner decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building now that we have more analysistic with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of options, correction, stranger alternatives -- confused, making it real. Calculator, we can handle more categories with less choices, to drive complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented you were designed to help manage the alternatives or better for you, for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who they serve.
I think that the key to getting the best of an election is being careful by choice.
And the more careful we are in our best choices, we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the '80s, in the Eastern East Germany, if you had a typewriter to write it to the government.
I had to register a piece of text text with the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of the text.
If you found a writing with the wrong message you could trace the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this would limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturing and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow printers on each page that follow a pattern that makes them own and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot of it for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can add the attacks on their attacks.
There are three main groups.
They're the civilizations.
Like Mr. Dimitri Golin in the city of Kirg, in Ukraine.
The cell cell is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the skins to make a lot of money, lots of money.
There are really many cases of millions online, multiplication, who won money with their attacks.
This is Lawana Taskas, from Haiti, Ethiopia.
This is Alfred Golian.
This is Stephen Watho.
This is Britain Sunday.
These are Matthew Anderson, Tasman Alama etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their little online fortunes -- but they do it by illegal media through banking transplants to steal money from our accounts when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in an infected computer.
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, frozen the Swiss account of this gentleman Sam Jane, and this account had 14 million dollars when he was frozen of it.
Mr. Jane was slowly spoken, he knows his paradigm.
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are victims of a cyber than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad in worse.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attractives in importance that we see today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have broken up in the last 12 months, occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main attractions, the criminals that make it for money, the habitats like Anonymous who do it to protect and the last group are the national states of the governments that attack.
And then we see cases like Diamondina.
That's a good example of government attacks against its own citizens.
Diamonding is a certificate authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
I declared the labor the last fall, because of a shoe.
They surrounded the security of the site and they set up a ship.
Last week I asked, in a meeting with Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people to cause the attention to Diamondina.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die because of a attack of these?
Diamonding is a certified authority.
They sell certified.
What do the certifies do for?
Well, you need a website with the Hitcher, service services Sylvia, services like Geographic.
Except to intercept a foreign certificate authority.
And they emit access certified.
And in the case of Diamondina happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt?
Well, in Egypt, the protesters took the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and during the blood of the building, they found many papers.
Among those papers was this carbon called "The AIDS."
And within that folder, there were notes of a set of company in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to be interrupted by the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 820,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The support of the company is right here.
So, Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also done to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago I found the Scott Hurricane, a tribate used by German government officers to investigate his own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is interested.
But today it's going further.
The connection to the Internet.
Using even tools like the Scott Hurricane to infect our computer with a tradition to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online arguments, to get our data.
When we think about things like this the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks bad, but I actually don't affect because I'm a honest citizen.
Why worry about that?
I have nothing to hide.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's on the privacy.
Privacy is not discussing.
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right we respond today, will be forever.
Will you blind in any future government, in an administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about over the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south part of Nairobi National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cow, the National Park of Nairobi, the National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi has no close in most of the South, which means that wild animals like the cells migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions are, and this is what they do.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we got up in the morning, and we found it dead I felt very bad because it was the only tower we had.
My community, the mass, we think we come from the sky with our animals and all the land to punish them, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up a lot of the lions.
They die them are warriors that protect our community and livestock -- and they're also upset with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there's so few in Nairobi National Park.
A child in my community, six at nine years old, is responsible from the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that this was actually not serious, because I even helped lions see the standard of far.
I didn't give up. I kept going.
A second idea was to use a shop.
It was trying to trick the lions so they thought it was near the standard.
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and they saw the shop, and they were like, but the second day, they went back and said, "This thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So they jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the stable with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come.
I found out that lions are afraid of the light that's moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the one I will learn and turn off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken line.
It took everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery supply electricity to the little Indian box -- I call it a transformation.
And the indicator box makes the lights disappear.
As you can see, the light bulb goes outside, because that's where the lions come from.
And that's what lions look like when they come from night.
The lights stop and they train the lions so they think I'm walking through the standard, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got to have trouble with lions.
And the house houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and asked me if he could put the lights up.
I said yes.
I put them up. You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, to scare other predators, like honest, legal, and it's also being used to spread elephants from the farm.
Thanks to this invention, I had the fortune to get a scholarship on one of the best schools in Kenya, Brooklyn International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and consciousness.
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to put them up.
So a year ago, I was just a child in the shoes of the savanna, putting my father's cows on my father, and I used to see airplanes fly in, and I was telling me that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
A water home. What in my tongue is, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard Turkey. Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric inventions.
What's the next on your list?
AR: My next invention is -- I want to make a close electric -- CA: A fence close?
RL: I know you already invented the electric clouds, but I want to do my own.
CA: You try it once, right? And you -- LT: I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a calculator.  CA: At the foot of the Canyon, Richard Turing, you're a big thing.
We're going to encourage them in every step that two, my friend.
Thank you very much. CA: Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No India And Nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim Institute, but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South America, Japan is the enemy.
Although I sometimes asked me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed all of a sudden suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor, and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
He said, "When you read this, the five members of the family will stop exist in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We're recorded together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a time when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a young child in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one would help them, because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge hunger travel to North Korea, in the middle of the '90s.
At the end, over a million North Koreans died during the famine and just few survived starts eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more often made energy cut, all of my around was completely dark at night except for sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the Armon River, which serves from boundaries between North Korea, and China.
As you can see, the river can be very analyzing in certain points, allowing North Koreans to sure secret.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that over the years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant plants.
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to go back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life was like as a normal refugee.
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because North Chinese refugees were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be represented to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was interested in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being Norway, then they tested my skills in the Chinese language, and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and depressed.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the interrogation one official told another, "This was a fake report -- she's not normal."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and depressed.
These women had a lot of luck.
Although they had captured them, they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, incomplete North Koreans are captured in China and depressed to North Korea, where they're tortured or incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can join in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to go back to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
In South Korea, it was a much greater challenge than I expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We are all corals, but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of divide.
Even a crisis of identity.
Am I surgery or norman?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with proud of me.
Even though I adapt to life in South Korea, it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the University exam to college.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I got a call alarm.
The North Korean authorities captured some money that sent my family, and as a punishment -- my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location on the outside.
They had to get immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the road towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China, and I went into the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put them together in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in bus took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked for all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I accidentally stood up and told him that they were deaf people who were accelerating.
I looked at me surprised, but fortunately I believe me.
We did all the way to the Lake border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the French guards in Lakes.
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested.
After paying mountains and soldiers, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of Lakes.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was arrested in prison at short distance from the South Korean embassy of South Korea.
I went and came between the office office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
It didn't have enough money to pay more bribe or mortality.
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man wondering, "What's the problem?
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without doubt the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I thank you with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I help me?
"I'm not helping you, he told me.
"I'm helping the North people."
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The uncomfortable shock is a new hope for me and for the North village when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of unknown and support of the international community are really the hope rays that the North people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I got together in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is just half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they came up to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language, work practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are in contact with families still inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from within.
I've been very lucky, I have received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help give you a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North reefs around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Central Central Center.
This is Central Center: literature stores, fast food, balloon terrain.
So the city planners came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Central to represent something more, so they changed the South Angeles, as if this would fix what's really wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  stores.
Like 262 million other Americans, living in a food desert, the Los Central Central Angeles, home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to carry killing more people than food in the car.
People are dying of curable diseases in Los Angeles Central Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times older than, say, Beviet Hillis who is like 15 miles away.
I'm tired of seeing this happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the harmful effects that the current food system has in your neighborhood?
I look at these business chairs and sold as a car used.
I see cells of collaboration collapsed like Starbucks.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
In addition to me to drive 45 minutes away and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have a perspective.
What I did, I planted a forest forest in front of my house.
In a land farm we call a garden.
It's 45 meters worth three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in win, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it."
This is how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Groups, we put together and we start to plant our food forest, fruit trees, you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid group for passionate companies of all the procedure, from all of the city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then somebody complained it.
The city came up with me and in summary, they gave me a tape saying that I had to throw my garden, the thylacine became a court order.
And I was like, "Come on, really?
A court order to plant food in a piece of land that no one matters?  So I was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
LA Times had the story written by Steve League, and I talked to the conference and one of Green Groups, who put a petition in China, with 900 signals, we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My confection even called to say they were responsible and they loved what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more balloons in the U.S.
It's 62 miles of balloon terrain.
That equals 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 72 million plants.
Why does it not look good at this?
It will grow a plant to give about a thousand seeds: 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars of outcome.
It's my hydrogen, when I tell people, grow your own food.
To grow your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Central Center.
I grew up there. I grew up my kids there.
I refuse to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufacturing to me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The garden is my graffiti -- I cultivate my art.
Just like an artist of graffiti -- that emerges walls, I lift soil, gardens.
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my embarrassment of that canvas.
They are surprised to see what the land can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a bit of a bit of a bit is and how you affect people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became an educational tool of transformation from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We're the land.
They were surprised to see how kids affect kids.
Gain is the most therapeutic and property act that you can do, especially in an area.
Also, they get free.
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and his daughter, they were like 100, at night and they were in my garden and went out and looked very upset.
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "Well, don't you fear that people will steal your food?
What I say, "For God no, I don't fear that you're going to steal it."
It's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health.
There was another time where I put a garden in a ship for shown in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous. I shared his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with their mom and their grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so it was just for a moment.
So Green Groups has come to plant maybe 20 gardens.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and participate, all of the volunteer plan.
If kids grow color, the kids eat color.
If you grow tomatoes -- you eat tomatoes --  But if none of this is teaching, if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, you eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're stuck in. I see color kids who are in this path designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the garden, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are accumulating their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington Cardence.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole range of gardens where people can share food in the same picture.
I want to take container and turn them into healthy coffee.
Don't get me.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is you have to sustain it.
What I talk about is to put people working on people, take the kids on the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want them all to become ecological renewable, superstars, supermarket gardens.
We have to change the script of what's a supermarket.
If you're not a garden, you're not a supermarket.
That the supermarkets take their room right?
That is your choice weapon of choice.
Instead, if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some mission -- to talk about making some measurement.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your panel so that we can plant something.
Peace Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Steamy sounds)   You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it takes a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that I speak.
And especially if you're riding in your bike and these cars pass out, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make perfect asphalt.
The performance period, a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and the water can move through it, so all the rain water will flow up to the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and they will never be speaking water.
The noise will also disappear in these pores as well.
Because it's very horizon, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has advantages, of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can get rid of it.
What is to draw? You see that on this road the stone rocks are coming out.
First a stone, then several more and more and more, etc., and then -- well, I won't do that.  But they can damage their windshield and not be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more harm.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
Oh. It's ready.
Backs, of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage looks like in this material.
It's a parallel aspettion, like I said, so it only has a small amount of warning between the stone.
Because of the intellectual, the ultraviolet light, the significance, this adventure, this blood, the glue between the sides, will be analyzed, and if it's set, they will be microblend and stay from the adventures.
So if you drive the road, you get the addiction -- as you saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about a matter of authority.
If we can make this material completely collapsed, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool -- that to clean up survival, and we can cut the steel line into very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the blood blood.
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel ice on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- a manufacturing machine.
The injection can heat up, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the button, the button will flow through these microbials and the rocks will look back at the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great manufacturing machine here on the stage.
Microscope oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to try it."
So they donated a piece of roads, 400 meters from the AIDS highway, where we had to do a test cart to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the road test, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples age, we put a lot of charge in them, we repeated them after our manufacturing machine and we repair them and we were able to test them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers, using the energy energy to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, and they can actually double the life of the surface, and actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to face first before you can show you how you act the performance.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woke up a morning with the sound of the baby in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally depressed.
"The Taliban were on my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school, he told me.
One morning I will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban stood up from Afghanistan and made illegal that girls went to school.
For the next five years, I was dressed as a child to school my older sister, which I couldn't be used to be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where we were.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that we were going to be buying.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us applauded in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew that we risk our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, the school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban suspected them.
We always wondered what they knew of us.
Did we be following us?
Did you know where we live?
We were attacked, but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a teacher.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total conclusion of a remote province from Afghanistan, insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father repeated it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It will go back two years ago, just to convert our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of all his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban.
For him, there was a bigger risk not to educate his children.
For the years of the Taliban. I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, "My daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can force your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, which is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you still want not to continue?
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the bicycle, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate in Bellighan College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was explained from his home for the courage of educating his daughters, was one of the first ones to congratulate him.
He is not just taken out of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I take it by driving through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 1850, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded Solay, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls going to school.
What's exciting is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like my families -- they take up for them, and even in front of a dense opposition.
Like Ahhh. It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahahman's the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went from Solabel to his village, and literally they were chosen to be killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you are the phone, a voice I warned that if I kept sending your daughter to school, you would try.
"Look at me, if you will, he said, "But I'm not going to hurt my daughter for his old and broken idea."
What I've given to me about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of us transport, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, often are the first compelling interests of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban. The girls who went to school are told in hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes didn't last much after the U.S. troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that advocate for them, that animated them, I see a future prototype and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and indications, and every day, Slova girls remind me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the experiment, "Haih, resistant to Gaddafi, fought against him.
But you never become a Gapotaugh Empire revolution."
They've spent almost two years since I used the library revolution inspired by the software of mass mobility as much of the Tunisian revolution as an Egyptian revolution.
A force with many other free citizens, inside and outside of the country to call a day and start a revolution against the terrific regime of Gamara.
And we succeeded. It was a great revolution.
Women and young girls were in the grass, demanding the fall of the regime -- by getting freedom parachutes, dignity and social justice.
They have shown an example of the deal of the disable discussion of Gamara.
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Extreme East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some loss of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and defeat the tyranny of the ground.
And yet Gaddafi left a card card, a legacy of tyranny and corruption and alternation seeds.
For four decades, the terrific regime of Gaddafi, the infrastructure and culture and moral structure of liberal society.
Consciousness of devastation and challenges, I've loved a lot of other women, rebuild civil civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and right towards democracy and national reconciliation.
There were about 200 organizations in Benjamin during the day, and immediately after the fall of Gamardo, about 300 in Tribe.
After a 33 year-old period, I went back to Libya, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops about development development and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the Plato of Women Liberia for Peace -- a movement of women, leaders, very diverse orientation, to advocate for the social autonomy of women and for our right participation in building democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the preparing period, an environment that was getting more and more polarized -- that the model of the selfish and explosion politicians.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won 17 percent of the National Congress in the first 52 years.
However, little by little, the power of choices and revolution as a whole, were disappearing -- every day we found violence news.
One day we wake up with the news of ancient mosques and Sufi toilets.
The other day I stayed with the news of the American ambassador, and the attack of the conference.
Another day we wake up with the news of the official officer of the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the military and their continued to violent the human rights of the prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, which is made by a revolutionary mindset is politically politically, and has gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The intolerance, and the expansion and the revenge.
I'm not here today at absolute to inspire them with our history of the success of the "Street Life and the elections.
Rather, I'm here today to trust that we, as a nation, we choose bad, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The spinal list and the alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national recovery?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still polarized and dominated with selfish policies of domination and explosion, both by men like women like women?
Perhaps what I was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, missionary and inclusion of compassion.
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what the choices needed -- that only reputting polarization and division and division.
Our nation needs the qualitative representation of the female more than to need the nuclear and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as indigenous agents and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting like compassion agents and missionary.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not only honest, but it also puts a practice in practice rather than the vehicle, the collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of explosion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destined by the war, needs desperately in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a rent that is about the intersection and the alternative between female perspectives and male perspective.
That's the real clothing.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in a social form.
According to a version of the Koran "Club -- "It's the word of the God Missistan, Oh Michael, compassion."
At the same time, the word "Ram," which is known in all the architectural traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word "Wattricult," synchronizing the formula and material, which provides all the humanity that men and women, where all of the tribes and all the people and all the people all emerged.
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the embryo, which grows inside the divine matrix of the entire existence.
This is what it says to us, "My mission would bring all the things."
This is what it goes, "My mission belongs about my air."
That everybody is given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a concern question, which has an equally incredible answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is what everybody does always, why is she stay?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who painted it?
I'm not a psychological, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just headed at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in the September magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green card Amber Express, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I created my twin soul, I was standing on the head with a gun.
The man, which I loved no one in this world, put a gun on my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of "Look love story, a psychological trap. Where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivors of domestic violence.
I'm a slide in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in Mario from the Washington Business School in Mario.
I've spent most of my career working for the company of "First 500,000 companies, between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burnish and The Washington Post.
I take almost 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black worker and I drove a minimal Honey Own.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions and all the levels of sentence and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of malaria are men, and domestic abuse only happens in intimate relationships, interpreting and long duration or, in the other way, in the families, the last place we want or expect to find violence, reason why, domestic abuse is so destroyed.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who stood him, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women of ages 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, novels and agencies in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met Congo in a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York subway and started to float with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just taken away from a university of Linea Leader and I worked on a very important bank by Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a boy of the field.
I had a big mountain like apples and a little wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that Congo did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He made it all at the beginning by putting in a period.
We started to go out and loved everything of me, which was ready -- that I had gone to Harvard who put passion in helping teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
Congo believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like no one had done it.
And it was why the literature in that school press and the work in Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is to be seduced and to do the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is to fix it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I accepted my work and Congo and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a lawyer love that was getting head in a physical plot, financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence threat to see how it reacts it.
And this is where these pills come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where Congo was supposed to be so safe to buy three pills.
One of them had in the card of the car.
Another one is under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma that I lived in a little bit.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those pieces actually were a message for me, and although I had never raised my hand, my life was already in a dangerous sense, every minute in every day.
The first physical attack of Congo happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the truck yet.
Five days later, when the 10 mortality of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's boyfriend, and I married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we would live happily forever, because I loved him, and he wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very really advanced.
It just had felt very advantage to the wedding and because of the fact of forming a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never be hurt.
I spent twice more on our honey moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and I lost me, and he gave me so strong in the head that I broke several times against the car window.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, was added by the traffic and threw a Big Mac in the face.
Congo continued to get one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in the three American women is a victim of domestic violence or acceleration at some point in their life, and the Control Center of diseases that every year 15 million children are killed, 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I stay in?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, love of a profoundly amount of man, and it was the only person in the world that could help Congo face their demonstrations.
The other question everybody does is, why don't you just get through?
Why did I not go? I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we victims, we know something that you normally ignore -- it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a malaria.
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is killing it.
More than 70 percent of the murder in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put end to the relationship after the vaccine, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent accelerator, even after the abuse has returned to married, density of financial resources, and manipulation of the family system of family to serve the victim and their children, who normally are forced by the judges to spend a time not survival with the man who belonged their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it simply doesn't go?
I was able to go, because of a last piece of paper that I came up with my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if I had allowed it.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, to complete unknown, and I'm here today because you all helped me.
We have the tendency to stereotype victims as specific headlines, substantial women, damaged women.
The question, "Why is it left?
For some people that is a way to say, "The guilt is yours to be stayed, as if victims, we will intuitively choose with men who want to destroy us.
But since I published "Look love -- I heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also expanding, that they learned an endless lesson from what happened to them and that recovered their lives and happy lives as employees, wives, and mothers, completely free lives of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a very typical domestic violence.
I became married with a guy and unique man, and we have those three children.
I have that black laboratory and also that minister.
What I'm not going to go back to have never else, is a shot shot pointing to my head in someone who says I want me.
Right now, as you're thinking, "Hall, that's fascinating. Or "Hall, how silly it was, but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, which are being married right now, who are being maternal or they were small or who are abused themselves.
The malaria could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to finally put my crazy love on the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end the domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the metal to the light talking about it with their children, their jobs of work, their friends and family.
They take their vision of survivors as fantastic and lovely people who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously to slow their scale and show the victims a safe way.
Together, we can turn our camps, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful oceans that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron Russell and for a while, I'm model.
To be accurate.
And I feel that right now there is an uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed it like this.  So luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first clothing change on a TED stage, so you have a lot of lucky to pursue it, I think.
If some of the women would be horrified, when they came up, they don't have to tell me now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege to change what they think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very uncomfortable, less bad than I don't have to use it.
The worst part is to spend this sweater on the head, because it's when they're going to laugh from me, so they don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also surface.
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a girlfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would harm the back and take the hair of the guy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although superficial and inexpensive, has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, to me, to be brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a certain way.
The first question is, how do you become model?
And I always say, a package discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the benefit of a heritage and maybe you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries not only have we defined beauty as health, juvenile and symmetry -- which we're biologically programmed to admit, we have also associated it to a high and spiritual shape to the feminist and a white skin.
And that's my heritage that I've been able to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing school, and maybe there are some love of the fashion they say, "Hope -- there are Namibia, T, Joan Smiths, Line Wink.
First of all, happy to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at New York City told each and every one of the models in the passage, and from the 1770 models, only 27 -- is to say, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always do is: Can you be a model when it's up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know about that.
But then, what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Nigerian carbon surgeon, which would be impressive, because you would be the first one.
If after this spectacular list, you still insist -- no, no, Cambridge, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my boss.
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of redesigning American voice or the CEO of HIV, or the next Steven Mesile.
To say that the greater you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you are larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike the traditional surgery, you can summarize right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've finished your studies, and you have a curriculum and a few jobs to your back, no matter what you say is, if you say you want to be president of the United States, but your curriculum said, model of interior clothes for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are resolved.
And yes, they pretty much resolved all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture they took me, and also the first time I used a biomathering, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a girl.
So I light up with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I'm on a piece of pieces a few days before the photos for French Voice.
Here I am with my football team and Virgin magazine here.
And this is me in the today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not myself in those pictures.
They're creating a group of professionals, military, males, photographers and sticks, and all their help and pressure people and production, and they managed to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is: Do you get free things?
I have too many tops of 20 inches and I never use, except the previous couple but the privilege that I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to make money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a little bit of a driver, and he jumped a red shower and of course, and then they stood up, and I was able to get a feeling of it, agent, so I could continue to drive.
I enjoy these privilege for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect without matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the 140 teenagers who were stopped and received, 86 percent were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 1777 young black and Latino people in New York, so for them, isn't it a question of me?
But how many times are I going to stop me? How many times do you do?
By researching for this talk, I learned that 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people do is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit more thin and you have the most brilliant hair, you will feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like this.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and it's also amazing to work with creative people, ingenuity and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair, will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most thin legs, the brightest hair and the clothes more to fashion but probably the most physically insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest benefits.
If there's something that will laugh from this talk, I hope that everybody is more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 most precious pictures, and I didn't go to me who pulled them.
There were no artistic directors, no statistics, no opportunity to repeat photos -- not even a minimum care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them into random tourists.
My story starts when I found myself in New York City to give a pointing, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the 57th and five.
He gave the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take Save to New York in a father trip and keep the rituals at all?
This is when we started asking the tourists that were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has denied and fortunately, never anyone has been done with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so that a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in a week of October and we will reflect about our time and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new kids, and I can see life through your eyes and how it feels and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking on, when suddenly he stood up in dry and pointed a red board of the wrist of dolls that I loved from small in previous visit.
And I described what I felt at five years of foot in that same place.
I started to remember his heart papertic with force when I first saw that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what I look at in New York are universities, because it's decided to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging actively in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one I get to the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to go on the picture, and they don't try to get somebody and ask it, and do you take a picture of it?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
Birth is in the most threatened bird group.
First of all, why do they have so bad press?
It has also been associated with personalized laughter personalized as mental characters, dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press press, you apply and scanning these are the attributes that associate with the Kenyan Parliament. But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because Parliament members don't keep clean the environment.  The paradigms don't help prevent disease radiation.
They are all money --   They're far away from extinct.  And my favorite, the bits have better presence.   There are two kinds of big bits on this planet.
There are the biosphere of the New World who are mostly found in the Americas, like conflicts and cardiovascular and the biosphere of the old World World where we have 16 species -- from these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the biomass important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services, clean.
They are our natural garbage recovers.
They wipe up the cards to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that no longer will be extended and causes large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no bits, the caves take three to four times a time to drive, and this has huge branching branching in disease.
Bits also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated to the ancient Egyptian culture.
Newton was the symbol of the protein and the material, and along with the cobra shut the unit between the height and the Egypt.
In Indian mythology, Japan was the baseball god, and he risked his life to save the Chinese goddess of the 10 head Devil.
In the Tibetan culture, a lot of very important people to open sky, in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to believe them, so these bits provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the biggest ones?
We have eight species of big bits in Kenya, which six are in extreme extension of extinction.
The reason is that they're being invented, and the reason they are being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and fantastic. The passenger communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the bits are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of bits are in the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from the winning consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like Dictator.
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India, and they've taken a posture.
Since there's no bits, there's been a spread in the number of street dogs in cardboard seats, and when you have street dogs -- you have a huge time bomb for rage -- the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, 380 agricultural agricultures are going to be above Lake Turkey.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're birds of birds.
In Western Africa, there's a horrible trade of bit of brain buttons to serve the brother and the feature market.
So what is it doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're putting them transparent.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries, so focus on a problem locally isn't going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the bits, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that they provide.
How can you help help? You can become active and make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very innovative creatures. donate your time to spread the word. Discovery the word.
When you go out of this room, you're going to report about the bits, but you talk to your families, with your children, with your neighbors on the baseball.
They are very elegant. Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending in the sky.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do professionally, my life has been shaped by seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1970 to 1977, I am young, but I am no longer --  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East Coast in Marine, Argentina and Somalia, in technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO and every project we set up in Africa.
And I was dentisted.
I thought, at the age of 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we played we and analyzed.
Our first project, which inspired my first book "Orangles," was a project where we Italians decided to teach people from Zambia.
So we came with Italian seeds south of Zambia, to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the Zambai River, and we teach local local tomatoes and ships and and and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't happen.  We were astonished that the local people, in so fertile valley, had had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that you didn't cultivate anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  Right in time to save people from Zambia from the human family."
And of course, everything in Africa was really crushed.
We got these great tomatoes -- in Italy, a tomato would grow this size -- in Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the vaccines, "Look at the farmers that agriculture is agriculture."
When the tomatoes were beautiful, mature and red, overnight.
And the vaccines said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why didn't you say that? You never asked.
I thought we were just the Italians we had errors in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans did, what the English did, what the French did, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the spines.
They should see the waste --  You should see the waste that we give you the people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading "The Dead Development of Damai Moso, evolutionary economics.
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western national countries, we've trained the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has happened.
Just read your book.
Watch it from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are impossible, collaborative missions and we treat people just in two ways, or we patterns, or we're paralyzed.
The two words come from the Latin Ratin root -- which means "Pathy."
However, they mean two different things.
Parachis, I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot.
Pattern, I treat all of a different culture as if they were my services.
So the white in Africa are called "Baby," head.
That book gave me a barrier in the face -- "The little thing is beautiful -- written by School, who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be help, declines alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to breathe.
This morning, the gentleman he opened up this conference put a base on the ground and said, we can imagine a city that isn't neuroscience?
I decided at the age of 27 to just respond to people, and I invented a system called Factorish company where you never start anything, but it becomes a service of local passion, the service of local local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You shut up.
It is never going to a community with an idea, and it feels with the people in the locality of life.
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe -- we got together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give some idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you do?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, we heard them, but not community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never go on, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they've identified it.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one and we work face-to-face -- you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of company, the business family doctor, which is established with you in your house, on the table of your kitchen, in the coffee, and helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way to make your life.
I started this as a test in Speling, Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this conference based on which we got to tell them what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects in march, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it? And I said, "I did something very, very, very difficult.
I fell down and hear you."  So the government says, "Hey again.  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying.
Peter Duaria, one of the most great business assistants in history, died at the age of '96, a few years ago.
Peter Duarian was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter Druggilicare, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of innovation in innovation.
planning is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now you are rebuilding Christophia without knowing what people most standing in Christopher want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to conversation with you.
You have to offer them conservative, privacy, you have to be fantastic when you help them, and then you will come up, you will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion passion?
What are you presenting more this morning here?
Local people passionate -- that's what you've apply.
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fossil revolutions, manufacturing -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The face as a way of holding machines is not sustainable.
What we need to consider is how we nurture ourselves, we cure, we educate, we transfer to seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for green revolution, universities?
Good? Forget it.
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's a remarkable story that I read in a future magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year 1860.
And in the 1860s, this group of people came together, and they speculate about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was this: New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and they pointed out, if the population keeps growing up to this rate, to transplant to the population of New York around them, they would require six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already being allowed to expand.  So in 1860, they were spreading this dirty technology that would build New York life.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came up with 1,000 automotive manufacturers -- 100.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few scans, scales, factories in parking places.
Devil, Michigan. Henry Ford Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them conservative.
Otherwise, you won't come to conversation with you.
Then you have to offer them an absolute one, dedicated service, enthusiasm.
And finally, you will have to tell you the truth with respect to entrepreneur.
The smallest company, the largest company, has to be able to do three things much much -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with fantastic marketing and you have to count with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can make, selling and looking for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've been researching and looked at the 100 companies of the Carnegie world, Western, Edison -- all the new companies, Google, Hall.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, just one: No one was started by one person.
Not the word "I," but the word "Well, 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone. No one.
So we can create the community where we have factors, who come from a small business environment sitting in catastrophes, in bars next to their drugs that are going to do for you, what someone did for you who talk about this epidemic, someone who talks to you, what do you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look for the money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Would I want you to look for someone for you?"
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange much knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like automatics, plants and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their approach?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories from our buildings abandoned and understand our landscape?
How do we share our hopes in the empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I'm love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with the giant robots that give a shadow to lovers and shortcuts and soldiers for the time and trust in a city.
That always gives the music.  There's a depression in New Orleans.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the largest amount of properties in America.
I live near this house and I thought how I could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was Joan as a mother for me.
Her death was repeated and unexpected to death.
I thought a lot about death.
And this produced me a profound gratitude for living time.
It gave me clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I managed to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let me catch the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house abandoned in a giant board and painted about her phrases to complete the "desire to complete "desire? "Because I want to die.
So the treatments could take a chalk. reflect about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept covering it.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I died, I want to be judge by paradigm?  Before I died, I want to sit on the line of date change line."
"I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a tree.
"I want to live outside the network."
Before I died, I want to hug it once more."
Before I died, I want to go to somebody's rescue.
"Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This space abandoned with a building and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at the cards, they destroyed me, and they gave me comfort in hard moments.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and slides. It's about giving the reflection to reflection and pollution, and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues of the civic center, we did a kit and now have done walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we show the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express us and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of increase, it's more important than ever, to find ways of preserving the perspective and remembering that life is short and delicate.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that make us more power.
To think about climate death our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fear and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers now.
Remote is 22 years old, it's high and very full.
I don't talk about, but it transmitted joy better than some of the best speakers.
Remember knows what love is.
You share it including what happens.
It's not farmer. It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this, never lied.
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to make words that I couldn't even remind me, I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very full.
It has the most implanted memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year I came out every single song of my iPod -- conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I pasted my arm in my arm during the first episode of the Tunisian and the Leads Garage.
Don't you feel amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't adjust to the concept of normal society, they're often ignored.
But what drives my heart, and I strengthen my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them within the ordinary thing, that could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary and authenticity and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term autism, it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it's manifest differently, from there that Remote is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development of development that faster increases in the world, there is no cause or current cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I was living in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that would be between media.
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more evidence.
But beyond the brows, frustration and intelligent hypertension, there was something really unique -- a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without press, a human being that had never lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times I would have wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuals, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
Normal is the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could transmit one thing to Remote and Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- are a dog -- each of us has a gift inside of it, and honestly, the pursuit of normal.
The opportunity for greatness and progress and change dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what should be Alice in the country of Marshall.
Penn State asked me to have a communications teacher, which gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  scared of truth -- scared of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big books and unknown words.
But when they develop those conversations -- I felt what Alice should have felt when he fell through the corn of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I felt when I had those conversations with the students, and I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to the environment and health care, among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please benefit with simple.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First questions to answer us, and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
They don't tell us simply that they study the work, but they study the work, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the opposite.
And when they are describing their science, care with the jargon.
The goal is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say space and textile, but why don't I say space and time that is much more accessible to us?
Make them accessible is not the same as making them total.
Instead, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of standing and excited with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget the signs of "ball."
They've wondered why they call the balls?  What do the balls? The balls kill and kill their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the area of the language of our brain and absolutely overwhelmed us.
Instead, this example of Genetic Brown example is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of working is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower of the Einstein.
The trick here is to use a simple phrase, legal, that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that go forward to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is described.
I think these are just some key ones that can help us open the door and look at the country of wonders that are science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, for all the media, full with simple.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the Oxford English Dictatorship is "Starship."
Just because it sounds very good.
And "Slong means "putting policy display."
Although there was a senior editor of the 19th century who defined it a lot better when he said, "A "Start is the one that looks for a public charge without matter, platform or principle, and that, when I win, you get it for the mere use of a monitoring self-assembly monitor.
I have no idea what the reality means definition."
Something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't until -- for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliamentary camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the instant name of Brazil Craig, who confronted the Parliament.
They got back at the London Tower and they turned him, but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end of it had such a popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use record of the phrase that "budget as born as the metal metal."
Most of them think it's lithium.
It's not. It's for a freedom of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact -- I want you to go back to America, just after independence, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a reputation country?
This was departed in Congress for a long time.
All kinds of suggestions that could be frustrated.
Some of you wanted to call it "Jeffish from State Washington, and others, "Your Black George Washington and other "Development of the American Well-being People.
Not very attractive.
Some just wanted to call it "King."
They thought it was profitable treatment.
And not even with it was monitors, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a certain term.
And I could have served it.
Everybody gets into immediately, because this debate is planned for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor Senator and I always wrote, even with this theme."
What caused the report and the back was that the Campaign of Repercondication was against Senate.
The Cameroon of Repercondication didn't want Washington to be embarrassed from power.
They didn't want to call it Rey by whether he gave him or his source ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more modest and more inefficient and more launched than it was happened.
And that title was "President."
President. They didn't invent the title. There was no longer before, but it just meant someone who owns a meeting."
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much bigger than the term "capture or "surface."
There were environmental presidents of small colonies and government failure, but it was really a resilient title.
And so the Senate is optimized.
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it President."
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with foreign diagrams."
"And who will take a serious title with a title.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't call up.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never meant the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate to be in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is a temporary --  -- you may continue to wait for 22 more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this I want to leave you, is that the U.S. President title doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to disparate, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of blood vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have shot the title of gravity.
So at the end won the Senate in the end.
They got their responsibility title.
And also the other concept of the Senate, the singing appearance -- well, it was a silent for then.
But you know how many nations are they preserved now?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So in the end, the Senate won and the Cameroon of Representations lost because nobody is going to feel humble when they tell them that they're now the U.S. President now.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and I would like to leave you with.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but in fact, the reality is much more modified the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of sweat bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but especially that cardiologist of male and stone standards with primitive tools.
As the other ones -- I take a giant light of ink light on the head with this stranger elephant, and I can barely distinguish the branches that hold the walls of that hole of a meter that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
My hand was restored and suddenly I remember a mining that I met days before, which lost control and fell incremental meters in that period.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep of that hole taking their lives without paying and representative, and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it, because they are prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only exhibition at the Campaign of Vancouver.
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a "Beauty interface of the Supernovassake, a NGO who was dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew it exists in the world but not such a grade.
When we finished talking to me I felt very bad, honestly, I was ashamed to ignore this attraction of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got a side of the stomach, and then weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of "The Spaces and offer my help.
It started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few -- even I considered them my second home.
But this time, I would sell the dirty tracks.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced throughout all of the treatment of transparent slaves.
150 years ago the cost of an agricultural slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars.
However, today you can enslave the entire families for generations for general degrees of 18 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits of more than 13,000 dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false promises of good education and better work to then find that they're forced to work without pay, under violence and can't escape.
Today slavery is operating in trade, the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are deserved.
slavery exists in almost everybody and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal I met the Dutch holes.
This strange and wonderful show was like entering the old Egypt or the Deniter of Danger.
In a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, factors in a heavy pollen standard -- they stack mechanically bricks on their heads, to 18 at a time, and they take them from the honest hormones to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
They were delivered by the monkey and the confidence works in silence, doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no passions to eat, not to drink, and the severe drawing made it really intensely introduced.
So penishing was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to reverse it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the oven, I wanted to cry, but the ability that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "Look, don't do it. Don't do it."
And it explained to me very clearly that showing emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a city of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were already gone.
I had to trust the Superness and work inside the system for his release and trust that they would get it.
As a matter of me, I hope to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found children taking rocks for miles by mountain terrain to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big plans were more heavy than the kids who carry them and kids hold them into their heads with streams made out of sticks made of panels, ropes and hot.
It's hard to pay something so absolutely.
How can we influence something so inequality, but so official?
Some of you don't even know that they're slaves -- and you're working 16 or 17 hours a day without pay, because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to compare to.
When these villages took their freedom, the schools were mostly burned their houses.
When we hear the word slavery we often think of sexual traffic, and because of this global consciousness I was embarrassed to me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Kamman they would take me women who had been previously sexual slaves.
I was driven by a few alien stairs that gave this dirty basement, of a little bit of flower light.
It wasn't exactly a blue.
It was rather a restaurant.
It is resolved in the office, they're local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private areas, where the woman slaves with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to engage the clients and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each dot is dark and dirty, identified by a number on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sexual abuse by their clients.
And standing on the publishing, I remember having felt a little angry fear, and at that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a savings, the stairs where I walked in.
There were no hind doors.
There was no window enough to track.
Those people don't have scanner and, because we play a subject so hard, it's important to point out that slavery -- even sexual traffic is around us.
There are hundreds of people enslaved in agriculture, in restaurant in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It happens everywhere, but we don't see it.
Textiles are another activity that we often relate to the spot of scanner.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families that were standing in the seafood trade.
This is a father of family.
Black hands of black are the father, the teeth of blue and red, from their children.
They mix through these big barrels and they dip the silk in the liquid to the eithers, but the fabric is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no freedom, they said.
We still hope, though, could go out of this house someday and go somewhere else where we really pay our work."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 kids enslaved in Lake Valley, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fish family in a boat, two older brothers, some younger children, makes sense right?
error. They were all scanners.
Children are separated from their traditional families and disappeared and forced to work sunnight on these boats in the lake, even though they don't know to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it was taking up, it was a little card that his little canoe was embraced.
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the trees in the landscape of the March often catch networks and children, photographed and fear, are moving into the water to advocate the branches.
Many are hanging.
Since I remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear to his love is not going to run up, and like all life has been treated with cruelty, it really tries to treat the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they lifted the last networks, but they had been working from the one way.
At night and sentence.
And I hope that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Kosove.
Kofi was rescued in a fishermen village.
I met it in a shelter that "Is the Salarian Republic of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
And driving by a road in Ghana with some of the Supreme So the Superness, a computer company with his engine suddenly accelerate and open our car and threw the window.
It asked us to do it on a road road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, he took us out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed up this sentence just visible, and he said, "This is the way, this is the way. Go!
As we started to go down, we removed the finals that blocked the path and after walking around an hour, we found that the path was attached by the recent rain, so I put the photo team on my head as we go down in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walk, the seventh path ended up absolutely in a clear and we had a mass of holes that could fit on a football field, and they were all filled with slave workers.
Many women had children tied into their backs, and while they were looking for gold, they were walking in water with mercine.
The market is used in the process of extraction.
These minutes are enslaved in one time somewhere in Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were embedded in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irrelevant, since many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have up to 90 feet and these people charge balloons heavy of stone that then they will be transported to another area where they will blow the stone in order to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and vertical men but if we look closer at it, the margin we see to do other lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this museum ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and the metric in a few years.
This is Mandela. When his father died, his father took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying his uncle, Mahmoud inherit the debt of the uncle that force it to be slave in the mines.
When I met it, he had worked in the mines 14 years and the lesion of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so serious that doctors said that it should be absolutely.
In addition to that, Mahmoud has tuberculosis, and, nonetheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams of being released and educated with the help of local activists like "The Sultaugass of the Supernova, and it's this kind of determination, in the face to a remote possibility -- what inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we would make testimony of them and to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not of magazines -- they're people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think about these beautiful people, malaria, that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see it, in people like you, and I hope that that force is going to get a fire and that that fire takes light on the slavery because, without that light, the beasts of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math, and there's a peculiar problem for whom to do it, we are like management consumers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try and tell you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
They give us the virtues of the whale and the clip dancers -- we will see more ahead.
But the whale demands an extraordinary training degree -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial attitudes that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's distributed destroyed this extraordinary ability, as I do with my friend named Jane Street, who, in his time, was a virtual dancer balloon.
Over the last few years it's been progress a lot in treatment.
However, there are six billion people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an incredible debating, temperatures, rich and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in objective ways, and in definition, the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have a objective metric and certainty.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement there are no biological markets, so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, they never do it.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a difficult journey to clinic. What if patients could do the exam themselves, they say?
It would not need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as not conventional way to try it, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all virtues like my friend Jane Strongering.
This is a video of the vibration of vocal corners.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds when they speak. We can imagine as the dancers of a vocal whale because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes. The Famile, for example.
And as the ball, it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning how to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal strings as they vibrate -- and as Parkinson's affects extremism, it also affects vocal organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of the irregular temperature of the vocal cords.
We see the same symptoms.
They bend vocal and weakness and rationality.
The speech becomes more quiet and aspirating after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with specialized clinical trials -- well, both of them are not invisible.
The neurological test is not invisible. They both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are accurate. Well, but even the tests based on voice are not specialized either.
I mean, they can be studying.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something goes up a cost so low -- it appears on a massive scale.
These are some amazing goals.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for a routine check.
With high frequency. We could get objective data.
We could do massive consumer recruiting for clinical trials, and for the first time, facilitators on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biomass of disease before it's too late.
So by giving today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's Victoria.
Together to Acceler and PhD -- we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 billion people in the world.
Anyone with or without Parkinson's can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents, and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached four percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So Max Richard, taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, can you say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What do you get from these shows?
Max Little: Yeah, yeah. What happens is you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
MS: You see, some people may not happen. You may not finish it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for limit factors in search of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy right now?
MW: Much more than that.
In fact, my student Thailand, I have to publish it, has done a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what I guess the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy now.
TR: Ninety-footprint and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
MR: Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Little, public audience.
MS: Thank you, Tom.
Before March 2011, I was making photographs in New York City.
We are pale creatures, gray.
We hide in dark, in rooms without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We make mobile models still more deleted, the perfect skin that we do the most perfect skin we do the impossible, possible and criticize ourselves in press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
Shortly time later, an organization where it was voluntary -- there are Hans Volestics, he was in the place working as part of the answer team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to the Office.
It's a little fishing village located in the prevalence of Iraq of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the waves.
The recorded water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles inside.
As you can imagine, the village was devastated.
We took cars from channels and the candles.
We cleaned up schools. Let's take the shape and leave the houses ready to be renewable and released.
We took tons and tons of fish fish, associated, local factory poster.
We entered and loved us.
For weeks, the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and Sataline cards.
They all did the same thing.
Take them and take them to different places of people around to get them to them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that those people had suffering.
As they had the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started helping in a village rating center.
I helped to clean the communal bathrooms the big, giant barriers.
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of the equation would pick up the photos.
And there they took them and I had the honor that that day would trust me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring. I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the horizon, but it wasn't until it was to transport myself that something happened.
By looking at pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that trait and repair that trait and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night came into Facebook with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started playing the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too extracted, but where the water had declared the face of the girl had to be managed with a lot of precision and delicious.
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the Israeli photo.
Over the time of time, they arrived for more pictures and they needed more reports so that it came back in Facebook and Lincoln and five days later, 80 people were offered to help.
In the course of two weeks, I had 150 people willing to join together.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Rumbery -- a neighboring village north of Alama.
Once a week we used our scanner in the temporal photographic libraries that had been installed where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time they were trying to deliver it is a different story, of course, depends of course of the awakening of photos.
It could be an hour. It could be able to apply weeks.
I could apply months.
This guy had to draw virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures plunged into salt water, covered bacteria, with algae -- even with oil -- all of that together with the step of time continued to destroy them, so clean it by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't play the picture unless it was clean, dry and it would have been rewarded by his owner of owner.
We were lucky with cleaning by hand.
We count with the guide of a remarkable neighbors.
It's very easy to harm even more pictures of pictures.
As Western said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
She had begun to wipe it herself but he stopped realizing that he was doing it even more.
It also had discussions.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to rebuild -- we could fix the images in one picture and touch the whole picture.
When he picked up his pictures shared something from his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the very far strands of where they used to be their house, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the forest to close the barriers to the waves.
It had to go inside the water while the signs were sound.
Their small kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and know that they all survived.
The day he handed her photos his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something he could go back to look, something that he could remember from the past that had not been mapped by that March day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there that hundreds of them helped us clean by more than 13,000 photographs -- the vast majority -- -- the great majority of their owners came back to their owners.
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us go back to 90 family hundreds of photos totally restricted and properly.
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials -- most of them in the top for printer.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, a place, a relationship, someone dear on.
They are guards of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take to you but the first thing we would get to look for.
This was what the project was about, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this is back to somebody, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of reports.
Some of them connected to something larger, to go back something, using their talent for something that are not being thin of perfect skin.
To finish me to read this email email. I sent it City the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I was playing, I couldn't help think about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathered around a baby, moved around me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my newborn daughter, hangs out of our wall.
In the entire world, in all the times our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
Chris Edgen inspired us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that runs an apple in an exhibition of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion to a billion frames per second.
I show you a new kind of photography, the female, a new technique so fast that can create videos in slow camera from light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the corners, beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenge the idea of camera.
If I take a laser spot and turn it up in a second of a second or be, in many females to create a package of places of just a millimeter wide.
And that paper pack, that bullet will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common ball.
If we take that bullet and this pack of photons and we shoot in this bottle, how do those photons spread into this bottle?
What is the aspect of light in slow cameras.
Now, all of this --   remember that all of this happens effectively in less than a nano is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coke did not take this research.  You have a lot of things in this film, which is generalizing this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our bullet goes into the bottle, with a pack of photons that starts to catch them up, and it starts to spread away.
Part of the light is flying, goes to the table, and we start to see these flowers.
Many of the photons finally get to the table and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, waves travel through the table, and because of the responsibility at the top of the top, it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the reflection is concentrated with.
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and make it running the same distance and we see it in slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much do you think would lead us to see that movie film?
One day, a week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  from a slow bullet in motion.
And what about doing with death nature?
You can see the waves that get rid of the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, he thought, from a memory at once, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this tomato, you will realize that, as light gets rid of the tomato -- it's still brilliant. It's not discovering.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the light returns inside and it comes back after several trillion billion.
In the future, when this female is in their cell phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is mature without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers -- you know, if you take a picture at low exposure, it gets very little light.
But we're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest exposure -- so just go into some light.
We sent that bullet -- that package of photons -- millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very tight synthesizing, we took those galaxies of data and we train them computer to create those females that I showed you.
We can take all those data in raw and process it in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
What if a new power of a sustainable future would allow you to see after the rivers?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. Rebel, go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light rebockets.
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left is our female.
Behind the wall there's a manufacturing and we will turn light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Committeers.
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our female, has unique capabilities.
It has very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point corresponds to what distance.
By projecting a laser you can record a picture, which you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But let's take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we will put them together and try and analyze the multiple light bounces of light, and with that, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D.
This is our researcher.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collaborations with what's going on to the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open.
Or we could build engineering able to see the inside of the body serving exotes, and the same for the cardiosis.
But, of course, because of tissue and blood this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about geometry as a new model of visualization to solve the world's health imaging problems.
Just like Dow Edgen, he was a scientist, he turned science into art, an art of demographics arranged.
I realized that all of the giants of data that we collected every time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can.
Create a new form of computer photography with slow camera and color code.
And we look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few trillion billions.
But here also happens a funny thing.
If we look at the waves under the top, they get away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order that the events occur in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
By applying the corresponding definition of space and time, we can correct this distribution.
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile cell can change life and give you individual freedom.
A mobile cell can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can take a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, upload it to Sunday and make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a 1980s and live in Berlin City.
Let's go back to that moment to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are protected for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people are reported that they protect for a change, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
Who from the present have a mobile phone here?
Let me leave them.
Raise your mobile phone, let me leave them.
Let me get it. A Bloba, a Blackberge, word."
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, my cell phone, and how I changed life.
Talk about this.
These are 35 800 lines of information.
Data in brain.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a director.
The Department of Details Research.
This director says that every European phone company, every Internet proposal of the entire Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls the who, who sends an email to who he sends an email.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in its phone company or its Internet proposal.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data feedback.
We want a disconnect in the digital age, and we don't want the phones and the Internet providers store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out of the streets of Berlin and said, "Liver, not fear."
And some even said that this would be the Star 2.0 today.
The East was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered whether this works really if this works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Any time I use the mobile?
So I asked my phone to him, Detroit Toll, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please would send me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah blah blah blah blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're practicing my life.
So I decided to start a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Derartu Toll said no, we won't give you this information.
We finally signed up an agreement.
I would retrain the demand and they send me the information that I did.
Meanwhile, the German constitutional Translation failed the institution for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly gentleman on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Trip and five thousand acres of information lines.
I saw it at first, and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit school, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to go out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data retention means.
So, next to Zerberg Angeley and Opera Data City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom up and zoom up, go back and forward.
You can see every step I make.
And you can see how I go from Franki in train to colony and how often I call the road.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them among them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this great network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, which time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the groups of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the middle of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the East would have known who involved in this protest, and if the East had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The Berlin wall may never have happened.
And in consequence, it's not the fall of the Hir Court.
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to store them forever.
But authority and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for authority.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to give your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not going to be happening.
When you go home, you give your report that just because companies and state agencies can store certain information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store from you.
So in the future, every time they use their mobile phones to remind them to remember that they have to fight for authority in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen what?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen what?
I call me Mayan Zana and I'm not a warm, but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have brain paralysis, for that time all the time.
Look at me.
It's advanced. I'm like a Shake mixture of Shanghai.
And Muhammad A.
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not conflict and it can't be seen.
No one hurt my mother of my mother, and I didn't control it, because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
Just by accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I warn you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of the present.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go from space.
Conversations from Christmas are in the shopping center, driving in circles for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little disability?
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and C C is just one of them.
Of the opposite of the operation, I would win the gold medal.
I'm patient, Muslim, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If they don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park Cleveland, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood, and my disease had the same principles.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I could.
A lot of people with brain paralysis don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the "don't can."
The mantra of my father was, "You can do it, dancing cancer."
If my three biggest sisters cleaned up, I cleaned up.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents dropped into the school system, and they were sure that I would also go, and if we didn't take all the maximum notes, we all got my mother's shoes.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five, putting my talents on his feet and just walking.
Another technique that I used was to put a dollar in front of me so that it would make it.
The stranger that I take inside was very strong and so on.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten garden was like a bottle of boom that has received many burns.
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs now, and they continue to be all of the family --  I think nobody realized that we weren't Isaas.
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use "Oh the Muslims as a campaign.
The people I grew up with no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot seemed to be a lot that died of hunger during the radio.
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so I'll be able to help the dawn at the point is very easy.
I danced on Broadway.
Yes, in Broadway, it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with talents, so I can walk with talents.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a girl, so if my friends used tons, I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summer in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine every summer, we would become Mankhy.
In summer holidays often my father was trying to get married, so I drink a ceremony milk -- I was putting hot cups on the back, and I remember that the water would burn me my eyes and I thought, "Work, work."
But the miracle cure was the yoga.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before I was doing yoga it was a rubber comedian that I couldn't stand up ...
And now I can stand on your head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the General hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the U.S., the State of Aristotle, because it was in all the counterparts.
It was like the mass ship of the theater department.
They all loved me.
I did all the less intelligent tasks, I took the key note in my classes and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene of the glass zone, my teachers were crying.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the United States decided to make a work called Daniel very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with brain paralysis.
I was a black paradox.
So I started screaming the four winds, "In order to have a role.
I have brain paralysis."
At the end of the five? At the end of the end."
Thanks to God, I'm finally free."
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him Sharta Brown did.
I went to increase the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk of risk, you can't do the character."
It was a role for the one who literally had been born, and they gave it to a rate without brain paralysis.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a quick history of adding actors without disability for disabled paper.
By graduation, I went home, and my first accidental tour was like a stranger on a television.
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be applied from "Copy to a low friend of my salary in a sand.
Instead, I stayed there as a ship, I didn't see me more than the new one, and I was obvious for me that reporter directors didn't hire regime actives, not white, with disability.
They only hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Whispherman Gulf, Rosen Barrie, Elley, and all these women had one thing in common: they were commanders.
That's why I became humory.
In my first tour, I took famous comic comic comic friends from New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first cartoon that he took when I was on the account that I was at high speed by the freeway of New Jersey with a driver that had brain paralysis.
I worked in clubs around the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censor and without vegetable.
Some people say I'm the first monitor of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little deaf rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean Obama, and I launched the American Command Festival in New York City, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the Americans in the media and to remind us to the representative directors that sustainability and Arabic are not synthetic.
To integrate Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the stigma.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited by cable news program by cable with Keith Olepock behind.
I walked into a graduate dance -- I was dragged to a study and sat on a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, can you give me another chair?
She looked at me and said, "Him, four, three, two.
And we were in living.
So I cling to the desk of the speaker to not get out of the screen during the settlement, and when I finished the interview, I was pale up.
I finally had my opportunity and speaker. I knew they wouldn't be invited.
But not only Mr. Joel came back to invite me, but I stayed as a particular time, and I pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith Olepock was that people on the Internet are school.
It's said that children are critically, but they never been fun from me or a little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became business.
I saw clips online, like, "Why are you the ship?
"Is it dramatically?
And my favorite, Poor divided terrorists.
What disease does it have?
We should really write for it."
A comment suggested even that I would add my disability to my curve, without mentality, committee, paradigm.
disability is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't do Bean, then Beane can't make someone in the wheelchair.
Discriminations are the data. Yes, they clap man. Come on.
The disabled minority of the world, and the most supported people in the world of entertainment.
Doctors said I wouldn't walk, but I'm here in front of you.
But I have grown up with the media, I don't think it was.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My leatherback has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to walk through the red carpet flowering through the subject of the Susan Lucams, and the average Lord Architecture.
I got to act in a film with Adam Santa and work with my pain, the incredible Dave Matters.
It took the world to be about "The Arabs have become crazy."
I was slow in representation of the great state of New Jersey at the fall of 2008.
And I founded "The Children of Massaches," a charity organization to give people Palestinian refugees a tenth of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me act live, and I dedicated this talk to his memory.
Distributed in peace.
I call me Maxicar Zana, and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little boy of a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
I live in a small town in South America.
This village is near Muslim.
The droughts to the small village to poverty and the edge of the innovation.
Nothing for him there, you go to the great city, in this case, McDonald, Somalia capital.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no future perspective.
He ended up living on a tent in the city outside Muslim.
After maybe a transplanted year, nothing.
One day you read a gentleman that offers to take it to lunch, after dinner, to breakfast.
You know a dynamic group of people, which gives you a disaster.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to his family.
They present to a young one.
They finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in McDonald, under a blue sky star, a car bomb.
That child from that little village with dreams of great care was suicide terror, and that dynamic group of people were the Shadow, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how did a story of a small village try to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him income with it?
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing I did.
This was the first thing that I pulled it out of what we call "the "early period."
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the markets, young urban people who are unemployed in Johansardo, departed riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the "early way."
For young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of work, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't provide opportunities -- the history of the "early "early "do -- the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to the pandemics, will be the story of the 2.5 cities.
And in my hometown, McDonald, 70 percent of the young people are unemployed.
70 percent don't work, doesn't go to school.
They don't virtually do anything.
I went back to McCurd last month, and I went to visit the Madian hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in that hospital and was thinking, and if I never gone?
What if I'd been forced to be in that same person whole?
Would I have become terrorism?
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in McCard that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders in a business community.
It was about 90 Somali leaders.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was Adam.
He went at the University of Mountain, graduated it.
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate university, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect white for Al Shake and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited to be recruited to it.
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different way.
In McCard, the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
Twenty years of civil war have completely destroyed the visual system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize it.
They add an opportunity and advanced it.
It started a motorcycle company.
It started and showed the local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 motors, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point for hundreds of engines over the next three years.
Why is this story different?
What does this story different do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the "early person."
You get young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking at so desperately.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Muhammad Monum, a flower.
I was helping to train some of the young people in the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that McDonald's ever seen in more than 22 years, and until Molami arrived, if you wanted flowers for your wedding.
If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw frequency flowers?
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be not?
So Muhammad saw an opportunity.
He started a pattern of passion and flexible design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of McDonald, and he started growing tunas and literates, which he said, could survive the climate hard of McDonald.
And it started the flood of flowers for bottles, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now he's working on the creation of the first public park of McDonald's in 22 years.
There are no public parks in McCurly.
It wants to create a space where families -- young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial pink pink pink pink places.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of MoMA had a really profound impact in young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs, working for the government, but his story, his innovation, really had a strong impact about them.
I forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be artificial creatures.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They identify business solutions for local problems.
So inspired the young people and create a business culture culture is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to put them in development and put on their business.
They connect the young people with the resources that they need, to bring the support they need to move from understanding to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohammed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Peace Park, this is how it calls it, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
They take kids out of the street to help rent and keep the motors for him.
I gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the "early paradigm."
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, they turn young people into entrepreneurs, including and feeding their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of peace than anti-computer "desires."
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping up with my dad on the Adaptarian Mountains -- an area back to the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun made the leaves to shine as a virus, and not to be the way we go on, we can almost pretend that we were the first human beings to put that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a corner in a risk with a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible at all.
Behind the surgery, there was a barrier, about four square meters with hell hearts of algorithmic paper balls, and old warm warm.
And I was announcing, and I was very angry and incredibly confused.
The campaigns that were too lazy to get what they had brought out, who thought he was going to clean their base?
That question kept with me, and it was just a little bit simple.
Who cleaned our base?
No matter how they organize or where they put the "usual," who clean our trash in Statue?
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in London.
Here in New York City, the Department of Health cleans our trash -- at the reason of 11,000 tons of waste.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that load off?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through his trajectories and interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an intrigue.
I needed to get closer to it.
So I started working as a garbage collection.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I drove them.
And I operated the mechanical screens and barrier the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as predictable as they believe, and in the days that it's very strong one is used quickly.
It costs a lot of useful the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept advising the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Office of Laboratory Statistics, waste collection is one of the most dangerous abilities in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and they pass around you.
They just want to pass out, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the implant of the trash.
When you go out of the cloud, you see a city from the back of the road, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And there's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think waste reefs are the most important work hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first public health protection.
If you don't get rid of the waste of efficient and effective ways every day, this begins to deliver from your containers and your inherent dangers threatened in very real ways.
Diseases that we had controlled for decades and centuries go back and start to give us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old, we don't have space for the new thing, so the motors of the economy start failing when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, only your relationship.
And then there is what I call our average daily speed of news.
And with that I mean just the speed that we used to moving in the contemporary time.
We usually don't care about, we don't report, we cleaned or we take our coffee cup -- our balloon bag, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them up, we forget about them, because we know there is a force force on the other side that will fit out of it.
So today I want to suggest a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and include them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost tricky.
They're on the street every day, rationalism.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you expect them.
And their work allows us to do our work.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us leave us with ourselves, from our own waste, our failures, and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I listened to the gravity of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little child, and I went down the stairs running down, and there was a man doing his paper recycling journey as it did all the mirrors.
And I tried to thank him to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just associated, and he said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started investigating the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called Paulos, we worked together and made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to recognize the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and have all the costs -- even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The municipal waste, what we think when we talk about trash represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see someone whose work is to clean the garbage of you, a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of various stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Aber.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design about.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out and run."
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to restore.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the receiving with crystals generates heat inside the interior, so it's needed a lot of training.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees over the year.
And third, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a picture of trying to be so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really comfortable with the ancient market that is this structure in the air that thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small marketers and buy things every day.
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, a lot of floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced by inspired the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings we see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating at an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries in the building.
And this is spread with an inclined area that creates an air space in the building that is approaching, for its own shape, the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responds to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a card card with performans to allow the air to allow the air and also of light, but in a leaked way.
Then we were inspired in these beautiful buttons of the entertainment seats.
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the facade of it.
We're building that with these little private pieces that are the windows that let go through the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is completely completed with these little color crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center. It wasn't what we asked."
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the commercial center because at the end there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic, not only because of the material in comparison with glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning anymore.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve energy authority for the building in a city where electricity was cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage putting pictures on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these pieces on the roof, which actually collect water for the sandwich inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest I had designed -- needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the middle, a 1,000 year-old structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these patients.
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this measured the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell of the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in medication climate?
And it's normal, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we used a scheme that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with patients, and then on the low plant, we have all the connections for pedestrians for the peers.
And it also responds to local norms that establish greater density in higher levels and a lower density on the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like retroining the community of space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and social, and do things like running a two-hour career in the morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies to the same pace that buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but affordable to improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came into our class. It was as remarkable, as all the new girls.
He had large amounts of hair very bright hair and a small set of pencils -- lower the capital of states, very good for partner.
I finished that year and I was full of chains, until I brought my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the school came out of school, I was a little late and I hid in the girls bathroom.
When the coast was departed, I went out in the classroom, I took the table of my teacher in the radio book.
And then, I did.
I alter the ratings of my rival just a little bit, just a few things.
All like this.  And I went back to bring the book into the campaign: but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a frontier, it ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all God's lines and myself a row of A's, just because I could be there.
I still wonder what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt good to do it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught me.
It was that it was all dramatically obvious.
They never discovered me.
But most of all, I discovered the reason why I was bothered that this little girl, so small, it was so good for partner.
I'm intrigued by them.
They're so mysterious and so persistent.
We know that babies suffer from chains.
The primates. The blue birds are very prosperity.
We know that the cells are the number one cause of cave killings in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzed loneliness or long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to fiction because the novels are like the laboratory that the cells are studying in all their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no hell, there would be no literature.
Because there would be no Hello the infection, no "desire."
There would be no heavy king, nor "The thousand and a night."
There was no Shakespeare.
They would get the reading list of high school, because we would be losing "The Rounding and the Force," there would be no "Gates or "Painting? We would lose "Malahian Bornight and "Hang K."
No hands, there is no Professor. I know it's fashionable to say that Project has the answers for everything, and as much as the chains, it almost has all of them.
This year is 100 years of his masterpiece, "The Message of lost time, the most exhaustive study of sexual ice and also the ordinary competition, my own, everything we could have.  And thinking about Proust we have the synthetic details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a human market in a washing market.
We forget how hard that image is.
We forget about how impossible it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia World said were as hard as cat cloud.
I don't know how the cat clothes, but we assume it's surprise.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the chairs, the chains and Professor.
It will be very obvious like the chains, which are reduced to the person, to their wish, their images, are a not solid narrative basic?
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel children.
When we feel children, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being at the same time and audience, we know exactly what details will include to drop the knife down, right?
The cells make all amateur novels, and that's something that Proust understanding.
Everything that she does to put pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And he starts to say to himself that story, and since then, Proust says that every fresh love that San detects in his lover, he adds it to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that Swink and Project, they were necessarily choose.
You know, Project novels would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so happy to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?
The cells are advanced people.
It's a hungry emotion. You have to feed it.
And how are the chains?
The cells are nutritional from information.
The cells use the details.
The cells like the big amounts of bright hair and the cute and small standard of phones.
The cells are nutritional from photos.
That's why Institute is so successful.  Profit links well the academic language with the chains.
When San is in his cell agenda, suddenly he hears behind the doors and bribed to the services of their lover, then they define those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is represented, but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a monory."
He says, "It's scientific research with real intellectual value.
Project is trying to prove that the cells can be intelligent and make us seem absurd, but in their own way, they are search for knowledge, for the truth, a painful truth, in fact, to Project contact, the more painful the truth, the better the truth.
The pain, the humiliation, the losses, the loss. These were the pathways to the wisdom of Project.
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer -- causes us to make a range of feelings much deeper and more vital than a man knows that we can interest."
Is it telling us we're going to look for cruel women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the cells reveal ourselves.
And is there any other emotion that makes us open in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion reveals our agriculture, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at so perfectly so perceived?
Freud writing about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife would fit it.
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man, who didn't look at what his wife did.
She was innocent. Everyone knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicious without any cause.
But he looked for things that his wife did, without realizing it, involuntary behaviors.
smile too much? Or do you accidentally get stolen with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the cost of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
novels describe very well how cells make us look at intensive, but without accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely choices we are, the more we become fancy residents.
And for this reason, I think, the cells lead us to make violent or illegal act.
The cells drive us to behave in totally unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at age eight years, I recognize it. But I'm also thinking about this story I heard in the news.
A woman in Michael of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which was sent with flying messages, awful to himself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to include the new girlfriend of his eye normal, I have to confess that when or this, reacted to administration.
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge -- even though unfortunately, creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
It's like a Nigerian Santa novel.
Simmer is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the authority of "The Street in a Treater and "The Taliban Mr. Kiley, books that are dealing with how the chains, confuse our minds, and once we are on the sphere, in the realm of the cells, the membrane that separates what might be, can be punched in a second.
Take Tom Lilton, his most famous character.
Tom Lilton is going to want you or want what you have to get away from your self and to get out of what you ever had, and it's under the floor, and it responds to your name, takes your rings, empty your bank account.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom Killy.
I can't give you all the world, as much as I would like to do it.
It's a limit, because we live in times of envy.
We live in time times.
I mean, we're good at social networks, where the currency is environment? Right?
The novels show us? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they are in a mystery.
Let's go to Japanese Street 2012, and we asked for Shari Hollywood.
When people think about Hollywood, they think about the malaria in the Marine Professor, that criminal genius.
But I've always preferred to the Super Shoreouse, the head face of School Air who needs Hollywood desperately needs the Holocaust genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so familiar.
Lester needs his help, but he resists it, and he was futured with astronomy in each one of the mysteries of mine.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Adventist of the Sex Seconds, once Hollywood comes in, he would take all of us with his solution, Lester back to Hollywood and says, "We're not happy, Mr. Hollywood.
We're proud of you."
And it tells you that there's no person in School Air who wouldn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see Hollywood transplanted in history. It seems to me this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the cells as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in the Netherlands of the opposite side of Lester.
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly, Lester is allowed to admire that idea of being the research.
Could it still be so simple?
What if the cells are really a geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like conservation plans.
So as we wait for that happens, we remember we have the fiction to consume.
Only the fiction.
The fiction used to be the drugs, I invite them to the table.
And look at what's good -- the sleep Leopard, the terrifying Tom Killy, the crazy San Project, the same Mars Project.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Albert jumped outside of Apollo 11 of Apollo 11 and discovered about the Saramed Sea.
Armstrong and Alice were alone, but their presence in the world surface gray was the culmination of a compelling collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest movement in peace times in the history of America.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
Twelve walked on their surface, which Alice after the Army death last year, is now the oldest man.
So why were they?
They didn't take a lot of back, 387 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 would be scanned later, a new sense of the small and fragility of our common home.
Why were they? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in 1962, they give us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy -- some questions, why the moon?
Why would it turn it into our goals?
And you might also ask, why would you climb the highest mountain of mountain?
35 years ago, why would I fly about Atlantic?
Why does Rice play technology?
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason Pondon, for the contemporary, the Apollo was not just an West victory on the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was the market of wonder from the power of technology.
It was because it was a great thing to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological transport.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the police was eradicated and elevated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to be what Alvin Toll in 1970, called salary force."
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a candle bank, but in 1969, the Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human will have returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10, and the optimistic joy about the power of technology has been embarrassed by seeing that problems that we imagine to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be international results.
I remember seeing the Apollo 17 block.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that you don't look at the escape tube called the Saturn V.
I knew that this would be the last standard mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that from "Some happened to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologies would have been distracted and enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhone, apps and social networks, or algorithms that accelerate the automated sale.
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a radio explanation in Silicon Valley, which trust that have created less ambitious companies than the years of the years were funded in Intel and Microsoft and General.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the cultures, in concrete, the incentives that risk capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the venture investment caused the creation of transformative ideas for the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were on their lost point without worrying about the risk, they prefer small investments, the tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
The Chris have always had problems to invest in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is in the long term, they've never invested in developing technologies dedicated to solve big problems because they don't have immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and biomattereyan. Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the biomath.
We want power sources that can compete in price. They don't exist.
Now, the technologists and entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties will increase the development of alternative energy, mostly a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the coal price.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that look like technology, it turns out not to be.
We know from the time that famine is result of failure in the report of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famine are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like coasts or systems for storing and replacement of food, but there will be famine while there are bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes choose a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1973, but we soon discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terrible resistant resistances, and only over the last 10 years seem to have found effective and viable treatments in the last 10 years.
Hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we should, but these four elements have to be present -- political leaders, and the population should want to solve the problem, the institutions should support the problem: it should be really about a technological problem, and we have to understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, with those creatures.
But it's a modern model in the future.
We're not in 1960.
There is no gravitational competition like in the Cold War, there's not a politician like John Kennedy who has the hard and the dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even solving any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't lack the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to remind you the widespread ideas that you have about trust.
They are so common that they've become clicks of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a recovery, there's been a great decline of trust, is a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal, we should have more trust.
And the third is a task. We should recover trust.
I think the recognition, the goal and the task has gone wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a recognition, a goal and a task that I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has disappeared?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I urge to think that it may have declined in some activities or institutions, and that could have increased in others.
I don't have it.
But I can go back to the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the standard polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were unknown 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to inspire the same description.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still pretty reliable -- judges.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the road.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls are recorded are, of course, opinions.
What else can you recreate?
What you look at is the generic attitudes that people are happy when they ask certain questions.
Do you trust politicians?
Now, if someone would ask you, "Do you trust the groups?
Do you trust the fishermen?
Do you trust the printer teachers?
You probably started to ask, "What do you do?
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other notes."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to depended on trust differently.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of office, function or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying I trust a certain primary teacher that I know to give the kind of reading -- but in any way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my most playful friend to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is different, why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more abstract way?
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to orbit the good judgment in the fact of trusting something or in somebody.
Secondly, what happens with goals?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal I'm going to do.
I would point to have more confidence in what is a dealer of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a part of not trust what is not reliable.
And I think those people who set up their savings with the very properly named Mr. Madaman, which then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too confident.
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
I trust depressing or negative with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say that, you say, yes, okay, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What's about making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are they competing? Are they honest? Are they responsible?
And if you find that one person is competitive in the front matter, and it's responsible and honest -- then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But yes, in the contrary, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competition and honest, but I wouldn't trust them to take a letter to the mail because they're forgotten.
I have friends who are very sure they can do certain things, but I see that they overestimate their own competition.
And I'm very pleased to say that I think I don't have many friends who are competitive and responsible but extremely department.
If it's like that, I still haven't been painted.
But that's what we're looking for?
The trust is the answer.
Confidence is what we need to judge with.
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've been trying to build research systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, functions and others, that made us easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a piece and said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative paper than to take the part of the party."
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and institutional that the accountability system that is destined to ensure trustworthiness. And the creation tests are actually doing the opposite.
What they do is to make the work of the people who have to make difficult tasks like the parts, and let me show you the hot the children," as we say.
I sure you all know similar examples.
All that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more confident, and that things would be different if we try to be worthy of trust, and we're going to convey to the people that we are reliable and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the attitudes -- what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
I'll call the task to rebuild trust, put things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in definition, is different because we give it other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give enough foundation so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't deserve, usually all the people, all the time.
But you also have to play floating tests that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, does the common people, the functions, the institutions, very easily.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my ratings says that I can give you a little bit of explanations.
I take them and give me the money, or you change them by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing is not something very hard to discuss.
What people trust is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been working on reducing separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of screen that imagination can be decorated.
This separation has been reduced, increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there were no barriers?
I started imagining what it would be.
I first created this tool that is inside digital space, so that when the strong support against the screen transfers its physical body to peter.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool they break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all of your hands shop?
In the University of Microsoft applications in Microsoft, along with my mentor Scott Burger, I was doing the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
By combining a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, select them is as easy as adding a book of a standard.
You can dig the book and throw lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we go into the digital world.
What if we invest the roles and make the digital information come to us?
Surely, many of us will have bought and developed things on the Internet.
Now that does not have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual trial on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device in your head or translated into your head when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel it?
What would a future look like?
In the MIT Lab, with my author Hiroshi School, and my collaborator Remove Post, we created this only physical pain.
This spherical magnet behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that as much computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
Similar, what we did was we fled gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and mechanical action and detectors.
And when we digitally program the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can record and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach physically dear corporations and the famous thing at Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information isn't just going to show us something but start acting directly on us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to worry about our world.
We started talking today about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
They trained me to become a gym for two years in Hungha, China, in the '70s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to be transferred to an athletes for athletes with all the passions participants.
But my mother touched said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only a close path to happiness -- safe work and remarkable.
No matter if the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese single car.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer has to start training from very young to learn the activities, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
I wrote to the director of school and the presentation of a radio program.
But to no adult he would miss the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much greater to train.
My dream will never be done.
It feared that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved to look for another voice.
Anyone around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
It comes back to books.
"Moods Complete -- "The Charles Child Launches Child? (Literate Hollywood "Like I got to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were banned in China, of course.
"The Good Earth is about Chinese comparable life.
And it's not convenient property. I understand.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's one issue for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation. Hold your father and mother."
"Hong, I said, "It's so different, and much better than I would observe."
So it became my tool to get out of this conference of conference and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find a new culture also gave place to my computer reading habit.
It provides many perspectives.
For example, this map seemed to me outside because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
comparative reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and control, it offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if comparative reading worked to research, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading books of two.
You can try to get people from Bangladesh Francisco from Walter Island from Walter Muslim who were involved in the same thing, or friends with shared experiences.
For the crisis, the temptation are economic, policies and spiritual ones.
For the Buddha they're all psychological -- free, fear and the social should -- interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
"The path of Chancelon Turk Turkey Meroccing -- Thomas Meroffer Actually And instead of losing me in the translation. I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that "Happy in Chinese literally means "a fast sale of glass -- Jay."
And "New York in Chinese, literally means new mother." Oh Ohoo.
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back to feeling alone or powerless ever.
Having a dead dream is really not compared to what many others have suffered with.
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
It can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which today I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always get them.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first psychology of psychologist.
I was a medical student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26 year-old woman called Alex.
Alex went into the first session using bankers and a hidden tower -- he took on the couch of my office removed the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so an adventure.
My class company had a picture as a first client first.
And I took a seat that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought the sessions, it made me easy to just move the head while we took the solution.
"The trains are the new vehicles? He said, Alex, and so I saw -- she was right.
You start working after you go home later, you have kids after your death goes later.
For veterans like Alex and I had a time of support.
But shortly after, my superintelligence pressure me to press Alex to talk about his loving life.
I was resistant to me.
I said, "Oh, of course, he's coming up with guys under your category, you care with a head head, but it's not like it was going to marry it."
And then my superintelligence said, "You know, but maybe it's married with the next time.
Also, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before he happens.
This is what psychologists call a "The Army moment.
It was when I realized that the 30 is not the new 20s.
Yes, people feel head after what they were used to, but this didn't make the 2010 a pause in their development.
This made the 20th of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were wasting it.
So I realized that this kind of benign negative was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers and the families and the flight future anyway.
There are 50 million veterans in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that no one gets to adulthood without going before the 1990s.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20.
I want to see the verses here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with streams, you love a seat, you remove the dream a sea, I want to see -- it's good. Incredible, the real backgrounds matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
And we know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
This means that eight in 10 decisions and experiences and moments "Aheh," who shape their life will have happened to when they have 30 and so on.
People from over 40, they don't go into panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact about how much money they will gain.
We know more than half the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at the age of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its 20s, and it's represented for adulthood, which means that if there's something you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their 20s than at any other moment of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top at 28 and the things become complicated at the age of 35 things.
The 20 are the time to educate their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your daily and common life has an impact in the person that will become a beat impact.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development, and our 20 are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the vessels are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the timeline.
The researchers call the 2010 an extended adolescence.
The journalists are called ridiculous names to the verses as "the "the "the Telescopes and "Deads."
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a translation that is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Berlins said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you give you pat on your head and say, "Do you have another 10 years to start your life?
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their ambition and it does absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart versable, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say, "I know that my girlfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, but I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while it starts a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My 20 are in the end, and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better rubber the day I graduated from university."
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the 20 were like the game of chairs.
They all run and get fun, but then at some point around the 30, the music came off, and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay standing on, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was 30 one was 30."
Where are the seats here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but it's not wrong, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the '30s -- there's a huge pressure to the trains and so many of them start a career, pick a city, pick a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not compassion, and there are research that start showing you, which is much more difficult and stronger to do everything at the same time.
The average age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want to do now.
You realize you can't have the son you want to have the son you want to give you a brother to your son.
A lot of roads and courses look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their 20s, "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the vessels are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called Emily.
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but he still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a same time.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend that showed more temperature than an ambition.
And despite living about 20 very hard, his previous life had been even more difficult.
He cried often in our sessions, but then he raised himself to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every single hour.
I had just bought a new director for director and had spent the whole morning fill it with his many contacts, but then he looked at the empty space that followed after the words -- "In case of emergency -- please call me ...
He was at the point of the history when he saw me and he said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a car accident.
Who is going to care about if I get cancer?
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and not say, "Me."
What Emma needed was not a therapy that really would be worried.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the Emerge decade of Emma passed in front of me.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of the verse, man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma to forget from that identity crisis and get identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that adds value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of Emergence career, and no one knows the future of the work, but I know this -- I know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that interest, of that company that they want to try with.
I'm not breaking out the seasonal exploration, I'm taking out the exploration that I shouldn't tell you, by the way, is not exploration.
It's practical.
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are already saving.
The best friends are excellent to take into the airport, but the settlements that are together with friends with similar minds are limited in terms of who you know, what you know, how you think, how do you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who goes out almost always comes from outside their nearest circle.
New things come from what's called weak friends of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the verses have a bad job, or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way to hang this group.
Half of the jobs created never published, then knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job that was not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Finally, but not less importantly, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but you know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a vegetable, Emma soon chose to choose his family, when you have a partner and form your own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had arrived.
You might think that 30 is better age to feel head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person with which you live right now, or you care about now when everyone on Facebook start walking into the altar.
The best moment to work in your marriage is before you have, and that implies to be as intentional as you are in work.
To choose your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with anyone who is choosing you.
So what happened with Emerge?
Well, we looked at that director and she found the roommate of a cousin that worked in a museum of art in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That work supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend that I lived with.
Now, five years later, it's special events of events in museums.
This married with a man who chose constantly.
I love his new career, love his new family, and he sent me a letter to say, "Now the emergency contact spaces are not big enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love working with seats.
It's very easy to help you.
The verses are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles airport, which come out somewhere from the west.
Right before the shoes, a slight advance in his trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in Free.
In the same way, at 21 or at the age of 25, a good conversation, a good design, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea to spread all the versable to all the versables you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alexander.
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to veterans like Emma every day, and the trains are not the new 20, they take their adult, they get identity capital, use your weak link to your family.
They don't let us define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in general consulting for a work that was even more excited, the document.
I went to teach you mathematics to seventh grade students in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and testing.
They give them tasks.
When the work comes back, I calculated the grades.
What called me the attention was that C. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance didn't have CAPTCHA points.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that led me to think.
The kind of things that you need to learn in math in seventh grade, sure, are difficult, propositions, decisions, the area of a paradigm.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years later, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motor perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure more ways.
It's the Chance, but what if we have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in fast and easy way?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of challenging stage, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the military Milky West Pond.
We try to predict what chains would stay in military training and who would be retired.
We went to the National Conference of Dellow and tried to predict what children would move the most distant possible in competition.
We study flying teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, wondering what teachers will be teaching for the end of the school year and from those who will be the most effective to improve the learning of their students.
We partnered with private companies, asking ourselves, which of these marketers are going to keep their job post?
Who is going to make more money?
In all those very different context, a feature came up as a major prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't the C.
It was determination.
Determination is passion and personal performance to achieve very long-term goals.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is to cling to their future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a marathon, not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that made my determination questionnaires and then wait for over a year to see who they were graduated.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to get older, even when I showed them in every characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even the security they felt when they were in school.
So not only is it in West Point or the National Committee of Dellow in which the determination matters. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk of leaving it.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job of work?
How do you keep them motivated for the long plate?
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you destiny.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply don't keep ahead with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, the common determination is not related or even related to talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called growth meaning."
This is an idea developed at the University of Stanford by Carol December, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fish, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. December has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to perceive when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have in front of it.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they have been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to get wrong, to start all again with the lessons learning.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more determined.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan like a calculation daughter, one of my most stressed memories is my mother showing you the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for an extract, it seems to be as unlikely as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can throw this wall, so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic will understand 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic philanthropic.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read traffic signals -- messages of restaurant, understand the basic idea of web pages or the newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
They open your mouth as much as possible until it is short.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
Person.
If the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was screaming in a French way, "Alexander." I'm shown -- this symbol is actually original in the form of the call, but I like to believe that it's the other way. The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a couple doors of a song in the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks to create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's "kept."
As the ancient said, two are company, three are collective.
If one person would be your arms, this person is saying was this big big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is putting.
It's a prisoner as Jones inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the channels.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a "dine."  Easy to remember, because a paradox tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two fights together, it becomes very hot.
Three fights together, that's a lot of calls together.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's comparable.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two soldiers together, I thrive.
Three together, those are details.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the bridge.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, is the door of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Did I play at home?
This person is coming out of a door, escaped, educating.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing them.
Three women together, they have careful carbon.
So we've already gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight radiations will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, they will be able to learn a couple hundred characters of characters, which is the same thing as an eight year-old Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a volcano.
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the origin we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked on one another.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile because Chinese employees were forced their political enemies beyond mountains.
Today, the exile has become coming out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a salt.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the films that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my kids, when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
The film mastered his imagination for months.
His favorite character was Glamogram, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic variable.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial fantasy show of child fantasy show.
However, the Oshan magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a few years later with a few years later, and interestingly, another film whose protestions, a metal boy and a filter boy rescued a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the Oz of Oz and all the films that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the Oshan magician.
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like angles.
But I think that if the magician of Oz was done today, the magician would say, "Doctor, you're the saving of Oz as the protein predicted it.
You use magical shoes to defeat the computer generated military microscopes of the barrier male.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Odyn magician is that the most heroic characters and wise characters are women.
I started noticing this when I made Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son at that time.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of survival had gone down.  So he was shown in the room and he was impressed as a mom standing with his patterns behind it, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but I was inspiring everything.
I wonder what it is.
Would they be value, perspective and legal?
Would I have the feeling that Luke is an army to defeat the government?
We compare this with the 1931 magician, 1993.
How does Dorothy win his movie?
By making good friends with everybody and being a leadership.
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow okay, OK?
Why is there so much capital force -- force in the movies for our children, and so little the way of yellow flowers?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in girls, and they should read it. It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this status.
I know for experience that the Lego princess didn't provide the right framework that I had served to navigate the world of adults which is military.  I think at the moment of the first kiss I really expected the credit to start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search for me has done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they still standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the village and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventure.
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and they are going to defend Disney Princes before any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, the kids are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend the girls how to defend the pattern, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the pattern.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely like Heroesia and Katrina, but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to appear in classic after classical after classical after a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who create a girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critical said when it came out of Valley?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a principle.
It's very good. Don't let them stop them."
Well, almost none of these movies happens the Beethoven test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
There's no roots and no longer proposed anymore, but maybe we will start a movement.
Alikh Mellow is a comic drawing, and in the middle of the '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine about the evaluation of the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to do -- in the movie, there's more than a female character that has line?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the guy who just like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things between each other.
It happens. I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week went to see a very good quality, Alex.
Right? Routes in Oscar success -- an idea of consensus of what a Hollywood movie film.
In fact, it doesn't happen to the Beethoven test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in an embassy where men and women are hiding during the crisis of the reefs.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this school, and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "You come to bed, card?
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them think they have female protests?
One. It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress -- then it's fine.
But there's a bigger number than this room is going to do this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says that it's been sexually assaulted ever in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely linked -- but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual agriculture.
Who are those guys? What are those guys?
What do you not get to learn?
Are you looking at the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the village with violence and then cover the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and doesn't talk about?
Are we looking at that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistics and we want to prepare them.
Do we have tools to our disposal as a poetry, and we hope that that will help, but I have to ask, that posture is going to protect you, at the same time, active or passionate, are we educating our children to keep their male power?
I mean, I think Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of shoulder.
The definition of malaria is radically changing.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the role of home and the salary.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what he was his favorite character from "Star Wars know what he replied, what did I say?
Okay.
Andy Kenya and Glamogram.
What are these two commons?
Maybe it's not just bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories to say to my son, and I see and struggle just and struggle and struggle just and more stories where his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people better and be better people, like the Oz magician.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things I liked most was to look for sea cookies in the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these concepts.
They're covered with sand, and it's hard to see it.
However, over time, I used to look for you.
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me collect them.
This became a passion for finding things in a love for the past and the architect.
And finally when I started studying Egypt, I realized that I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles of length next to the Nichel.
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
In order to try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use infrared the infrared one.
This is a place in the eastern desert of Egypt called Benday.
And the place, in simple sight, seems to be brown -- but when we use infrared and we process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like bright rose.
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of ancient Egyptian animals.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Stanford, lost for thousands of years.
Stanford was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the Fash, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The Egyptians have always known that Italian was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that they built them, indicated inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge aluminum planning.
This area is enormous -- it measures about six for 4,000 kilometers.
Before, the Nich flow right next to Italy and as it changed over time, travel to the east and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a self-supported city in an extensive landscape?
I will try to find it at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a paradox, with the eyes sold and using baseball gloves and bananas.
So we used NASA partnership data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the norm.
But you can see more determined, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of Stanford.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing samples -- you can see it here.
When I say showing you, it's like the show of shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we seek layers of human opportunity.
Five meters down, under a thick land layer -- we found a dense layer of ceremony objects.
This means that in this possible location of Italy, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation in several hundred years that are going on from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period we think is Stanford.
We also found prime jobs too, corner, cure and category, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop.
This might seem like it's not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the window of the Middle Empire, these are the stones that were used.
So we have a dense layer of occupation that comes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry workshop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find Italian here, but we will go back to the place in a close future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have resources to catch young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably written in Italy 4,000 years ago.
Sharing knowledge is most of all the voices.
There's nothing like that on land.
So you see, TED was not founded in 1984 D. C.
Make the ideas really started in 1984 to C. C in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of the house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's done.
Now they visualize a group of new obese obese of biologists.
They're competing in a typical bicycle career and they are going to address their entry door.
I need you to look at this.
They're louding strong, they're sweating, they're going on a lot.
And they collide from front against the door of his house.
There are bicycles flying around everywhere, and wheels that are going on on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in advanced places.
In the lobby, the hallway, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the Guilla of the Gallons.
He's getting them out with his hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue hair by making you holes on the nose.
You can smell the glass ball and you can go on to the mouth of the mouth.
Go on the side and enter their living room.
In the room, and doing the maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney Spidals.
It's with a little bit of clothes, dancing on his center of center, singing "Hillian One Born Middle Time."
Now let me give you the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a path of yellow brick and the oven comes to you Dock, the Manhattan man, the Harvards and the Last Wizard of "The Okay, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the Memorial Called Of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, waiting for me, that this was like the end of a wise supercomputer.
There were several men and a few days of different ages and different hygiene.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once.
They memorize the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They memorize entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who could memorize with greater rapidly.
And I thought, "This is incredible."
These people must be phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Code who had come from England and has one of the best trained memory.
I said, "Well, when you realize you were a knowledge?
Ed said, "I'm not a wise one.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participated from this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained to do these miraculous memory acts using an old memory using old techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Cyrus used to memorize their speech, and that medieval academics used to memorize the world's books."
And my reaction was, "Washington? How did I not hear this before?
We were standing outside the room of competition, and Ed who is a wonderful and brilliant English -- although a little bit exciting, he said, "Jose, you're an American journalist.
You know British Spends?
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney Spiders how to memorize the order on a live Christmas deck in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not British Spenison, but maybe you can teach me.
Or do you have to start by something isn't it?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also researching it, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called P.
He's a conservation, very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a memory problem, it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic -- but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim Pepport. In he was based for the role of Justice Hawking in the movie "Rich Man."
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorizing phone guides, was centralized.
And when you go back, you have a number of treaty about writing memory about 2,000 years ago, in the Antarctic and then in the Middle Ages and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having trained memory, discipline and culture was not a thing as rare as we can look at today.
A long time ago, people invested in their memory, to provide liberal their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed us.
They have changed us culturally and I would say that they've changed us as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of trained memory, discipline and culture is this very unique memory competition.
It's not really so silly, there's competition like this all over the world.
I was fascinated I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at the University of London College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structure or antibody different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than the rest of it?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects that they compare them.
When they put them in a magnetic MRI machine, they scanned their brains as they memorize numbers, faces and forms of snow copy -- found that in memory champions are lit parts of the brain, different from others.
They were actually used, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves space memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The competition of competitive memory is sent as an armed career where every year appears someone with a new way to remember more things, faster, and then the rest of the competitors have to put the day.
This is my friend Ben Prince, three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 barrels of narratives that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only dominated.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 44,000 random binary diagrams.
half a hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competition, absolutely all techniques used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call the flower conflict."
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the paradigm paradox? (Ballycopy says this: I tell two people who remember the same word. I tell you that there's a man called Baker."
That's his left.
And then I asked them, "You remember a bacterial back."
And when I go back later, and I ask them, "Do you remember that word that I told you a little about?
"You remember what it was?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his work is "bank."
Same word, different ability to remember, that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Babylon, it doesn't really mean anything for you.
All the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word "bank? We know passions.
They use simple white shadows.
They have home in their hands.
They smell well when they go home to work.
We probably know some panel.
And when we look at that word for the first time, we started putting active ancestors to physically afford them at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is 2,500 years ago in the ancient Greece.
It's known like the "material of memory."
The story says this: There was a poet called Simulands who attended a banker.
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get a DJ: I was hired to a poet.
He stood up, he got his memory poem -- and he got married, and so soon it was, the room of the bankers are collapsed.
By killing you all.
But not only killed them all, but I hate the bodies by leaving them regime.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't bury the bodies.
One tragedy behind the other.
Similarities, standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the showers, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where it had been sitting in every winter.
I took the family families by taking them into where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What Simulands advertise at that moment is something that we all know about more or less intuitively -- and that is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or institutions for word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space.
If you asked me to give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Simulands, it's very likely to do it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the horse hot horse in your lobby, you would be able to visualize it.
The idea of memory palatic is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy -- the more crazy -- the fairly fairly failure, the fire is the picture, the more inclusive to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, to the first time.
And how does it work?
So let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it in memory in the same way that Carnego would have been invited if you invited it to TEDx 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to figure out some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and inequality to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely inspiring competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the Monterey of the Gallons who are lying on Mission Ed on the Earth.
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed Coke.
And then you saw Britney Spidal to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they would go into the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how Roman speakers memorize their speech, not word for words, which will confuse them, but typical by typical.
In fact, the term "thirding comes from the Greek Greenland, which means "classroom."
It's a glimpse of when people thought about the order and the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase "present is the first place in his memory palace.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of full on it.
I went to some of these memory competition, and I had the idea to write something wrong about this complex memory substance.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a politically boring event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting there taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is killed in the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put it in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school year bought in a plate market.
And I discovered that this was surprisingly fun.
I'd never expect it to be.
It was entertainment, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, cameras, properties, installations, advanced and optimated inclusive, in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a pair of oranges and some security gaps covered with tape leaving only two subjects, because disability is the worst enemy of a memory competition.
I ended back back to the same contest I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could go in, in a kind of participatory journalistic experiment.
I thought this could be a good role for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition -- something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize speech, and phone numbers, and buy them, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build the patholines of memory or memorize barrels of nations.
We often talk about people with a big memory as if it was an innate gift -- but it's not the case.
Great memories are educated.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we were deeply focused on.
The malaria palace -- these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even both forests.
They work because they make us work.
They have a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of the way that I don't have to go through there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
This is how things are made memory.
And if there's something that I want to leave you today, is what P, the aggression I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what already is our short existence getting us in the Blacks or iPhones, not paying attention to human in front of us, who walks on our side. Are we so multiply that we don't even bother to process in deep?
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you must be the kind of person that I remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we'll just be able to give you a complex place. New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from Dr. Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called Linds, and this was my child bedroom.
On the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom who shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony.
And there they all spent the time looking at the television. So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I got down and I wrapped up in a towel and you all see me.
And I was like this.
It was a tool, insecure and hated it.
He hated that room, hated that balance, hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Listen.
Those feelings, those emotions that I feel, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas -- but of those visceral connections, emotional connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize us.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you get and think about "Power," "Starious and democracy."
And I know they think about it for based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a department that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, very long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look at these stable, solid soldiers, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build -- the urbanizations and the governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know are going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Public Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome -- it has this round thing, collection, red relationship, that let you go into what Vivian tries to communicate with this building, the kids, the property values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both of these liberals, are they so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the film.
On one side there is innovation, the architects that constantly put new technologies, new types, new solutions for today's life.
We moved and we put it up and we push so much, that we completely get away from people.
All of black, this depressed us. You think we feel very well, but we're dead in the inside, because we don't have another choice.
We have to go on the other side and come back to connect with those appropriate symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like tracks, so we started to experience again, we do massive the back of the back and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we went out of the '70s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called brother call.
It has to do with the ants.
That can be guess.
Small windows in a democratic scale.
Something really hard.
So we got closer to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We push the forest back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that they like and we update them.
We add and we add pants and we use new materials.
They love them.
We don't give it still.
We take Chile arms and we turn them into skyscrapers that can be massively media made of glass.
The shapes were getting killed, they won in audacity and color.
They became collaborators.
The stories grew up to the size of buildings.
A crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own architectural fantasy.
Those fantasies could be to the Mediterranean, the French or the Italian or the Islam.
So possibly with a signal of bread.
This is what happens with position.
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we get memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the Toroble.
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we start making the film back in the other direction.
In the '80s, and in the early 1980s, we started experimenting with the so-called devotera.
We would download the historical symbols, we now have new design techniques of design associated by computer, and we meet new composition, a few ways that are crashing against other forms.
This is academic and ambiguity, and it's super impossible, you get totally wrong.
Normally, the dark spot again in opposite direction.
But then something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the Guilty of Billy, from Frank Gelman.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Gulf said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical, academic and public people in general, they were completely according to a building.
The New York Times calculated this miracle of miracle.
The tourism in Bilbao increased by 2.5 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those buildings. Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Spinux.
Everybody wanted one, and George was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these forms and wild and radical forms, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media were going around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism, we quickly learned that those shapes were culture.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the biggest mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism, they had culture.
This phenomenon of beginning from the new millennium, with other stars.
I went to Zalama and Liberia, and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all of the architecture, the digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next village to see a building.
Transportation is accelerated, you can take a ship -- an airplane, you can be turns.
The accelerate technology. You can see in the newspapers, on the TV, and at the end, all of us are photographers of architecture, and the building is being transported beyond their physical location.
Architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before you know if the one who designed four years ago was successful or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
Birth was not a two-year-old movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they wanted.
That's never going to happen. I think, because we're in the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the ants, the steel or the aspect, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the ground to media, it starts to blow up faster and faster, until it will be in both of the extreme extremes in the same way, and it really draws the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
Now we can do almost instant symbols with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that was installed.
This is the center of a village called Penns on Fish Island, in New York state.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as drawings looked exactly to the product, there were no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a media building, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes corporate memory, and when you charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell you what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those Liberians in Lindernes.
If that building is built today, we first go to the Internet for new libraries?
We would be bombarded with examples of experience, of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's musical.
Men who can take the Lincoln mayor to people, and tell you that there's no unique answer to what a library can today.
We're part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use breakthrough and complicated words, and you're no longer a publicly determined audience that doesn't accept anything that you haven't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't let you be integrated by architecture.
That means that the organic power of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Selicy can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick in ideas of what it should be a stadium.
This means that a few robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are moving to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve to make sports or for yoga or even one can marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East River of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community community around that cause, no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little penguin penguin, as much as the animals that are going to look at.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to do more ecological buildings, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not in opposite side.
They find an architect, put it and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give them a way to smaller spaces, local library, households where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Star.
He just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does that in that great way, typical of the children of a year, wandering as if their body was moving too fast to their legs.
It's totally beautiful.
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
He's laughing and chip, and he gives himself those big bits and her hunters.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me think, when I could do this?
How is it that suddenly we're not going to taste with our appearance?
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google, "Am I generous?
This is Facebook, he's 13 years old, and he lives in Dentine.
And as any teenagers, it just wants to be loved and face.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit scary. It's a little bit confused because, although his mom tells you all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells you it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends, or the school classmates tell him, he doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of it, I published it in YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a comment -- "Am I nice or am I a faith?
Well, so far, Faiza has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so desperated, that it doesn't even deserve the opera to think about them.
We talked about a healthy and normal and current teenager, which receives these answers in one of the most vulnerable lives of their life emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what are you taking them to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, characterized, giving me like this, committed, sharing, publishing, this never ends up.
We have never been so connected in a way, in a continuous way, in an instant way, so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your room every night.
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are implanted.
This environment, of being always connected, is adding our children to advanced based on the number of "I like to have and the kinds of comments they get.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is digitally manipulated by it.
What is the scariest thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
And where are they looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are part of the news of the girls now.
The zero stem models continue to dominate our passengers.
The tech technique is now a routine now.
And trends like, Israeli, Brooklyn, biomassifying and probability.
For those who know it, surgery means a property.
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are shared.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the supermarket stars of sports, and the remote singers of the sport.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our children to grow healthy and be individually balanced.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacity, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not trivial activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and how they contribute to society and the labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class arguments, they avoid participating in classrooms because they don't want to call attention for their physical thinking.
One in five are not attending classes at all.
And in the testing season, if you don't think you see enough good enough if you don't think you're thin enough to get a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't worry about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland and the United States and China.
And it's regardless of what these young people are going on.
So to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on its body is delivering academic performance.
And it's also detrimental to health.
The teenagers with a little bit of self-esteem make less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables participate in more directors are not healthy than they can bring them into food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people who surround them, and they're in higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all over this for what they make more risky decisions, like alcohol and drug consumption and drug drugs, aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and without protection and damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe that they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or have no greater adventure rates.
17 percent of women are not presented to an interview of work in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they look like.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that opportunity?
Liberating this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking itself, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of the well interested programs, without realizing it, they worse.
So we need to make sure that the program that our kids follow not just have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical particles for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental but facing this problem requires each of us that take the raise in the issue, and we're a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
By challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell us with the emergence of our politicians in check or the size of their chest, or to insist that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not because they look like.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kinds of images and comments that we publish in our social networks.
We can choose people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time a mirror beautifully?
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies -- to truly change our culture, so that our children are going to grow up all their people, valuing the individuality, diversity, including it.
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a period.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out in the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they think they can never be able to be who they are, or reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
How about his wife?
To your sister?
Do you have your daughter?
Sound? A friend of his friend?
It could just be the woman who is two different seats -- what would it mean for her if it was released from that self-assembly voice in his interior, that I promised him to have no long legs, mold mosquitos, a longer floor, feet smaller?
What would it mean for her if we overcome this and we would say raise to their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is laughing at us.
But let's teach our children the truth.
We teach the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for who they are and why they do, and because they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little transportations of a year age today, they become safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November five of November 1990, a gentleman named Stavendup Noise went into a hotel in Manhattan and killed to Merhea Kahashula, the leader of the Jewish Defense League Lega.
Noyapolis initially took it innocent -- but being paid for other loss charges, in the company of others, they started planning attacks to about 12 icons in New York, including tunnels, synapses and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be avoided.
Later Nairobi would be convicted by his participation in that attention.
Ella's Noileal is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 1983, being a Egyptian engineer, with a loving American mother, a primary school teacher.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam -- that very few -- even most Muslims, get to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require much to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human groups, there is always a little fraction of people who are sticking so deeply to their convictions that you think you have to use all the media possible for everybody to live like them.
A few months before the arrest was feeling with me and explained that in the last few weeks of week, he and some friends, they had been going into Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to Carley Turkey who, without knowing our group, was linked by the FBI.
When I got to throw up, my father helped me hold the rifle.
That day, with the last bullet I gave the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise all of us, especially me, all the goal in flames.
My uncle went back to the others and in Arabic, he said, "It was an abuse."
From such father, such a child.
At all, the comment was produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted to put a card out of 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them "the "American who means you.
When I was 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of friends.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody else was time to start and go to another city.
As I was always me the new class of class often was a victim victim.
I was sending secret my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of the class, quiet and record, it was enough.
So most of the time I went home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say it surveilled, to grow under fantasy, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was educated to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put on my thinking was during presidential elections in 2000.
In a university program that I participated in the National Convention Burn, in Philadelphia.
My group focused on the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a motor victim almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different backgrounds.
One day, at the end of the conversation, I discovered that one of the kids who had made friendship was Jewish.
I took several days to go out in the light and I realized that there was no animation between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of mine and frankly feeling very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe that it was infinitely.
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush Gardens, a particular amusement park.
I met people from all kinds of beliefs and culture -- that experience turned out to be fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that humiliation was a sin and, by extension, all the humorizes were bad influence.
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and least critical that I had seen in life.
Being touched by a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat loved people, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to hire the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be humory but I know what is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the Day Show."
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be incredibly honest about my interactions, and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my front figure in a moment where I was desperately going to be able to do it.
In occasion, inspiration can come from the unexpected -- and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, extremely, was not in camera.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my own way of thinking, and she told me something that would hold in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough with intrigued drivers and said, "I'm tired of distribution."
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not Zachban Europe.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decide to go out and put me in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to lead to violence, can hear my story and understand that there is a better path, that although I was driven to this violent and intelligent ideology -- I didn't get a fantastic one.
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against privacy.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those without sense, as I reject my father's actions.
And with this feeling I am here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Right now, there's a film that is projected in your minds.
It's an incredible multi-sharp movie.
It's at 3D and it has a study of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has anger, taste and texture.
I feel your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, old and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that are projected in your eyes.
And it has constantly a super-like voice in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in directly.
This film is your consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know I have a consciousness.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal films into it?
Why are we not just robots that we have to produce results without experiencing the inner movie of the internation?
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
It suggests that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness science.
Science is obsessed.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never exist a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, they promote that vision.
psychology studied obsessed behavior, the neuroscience studied the brain, but nobody mentioned the consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then, 20 years ago, everything started to change.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Pennsyland said, "Now it's the moment for science to bring consciousness."
And since then, there was a real explosion of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations until the moment.
The center of consciousness science over the recent years was the pursuit of correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kanahin presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of corruptions.
It's not a science of explanation.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that by saying that this kind of neuroscience work answer some questions that we want to explain the consciousness, the questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they correlate with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscience.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, I don't tackle the real core mystery of this material, why is that all physical processes in the brain have to be accompanied by consciousness.
Why does it have a subjective international movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emergent phenomenon like embarrassing, like the humanitarians, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical services are all cases of emerging behaviors, how the entrepreneurs work, how the hurricane works, how the hurricane they do, they adapt and metabolic the living organisms, all questions about objective function.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon, how we walk, how we talk about, how do we play chess -- they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem, the question of why is it that everything behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here is the standard paradigm of the setting, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a heart scientist.
I want a scientific theory of adult that works, for a long time, hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we stand at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations, great. We used to be used to this: physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is kind of a analysis, something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know yet yet.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first seem crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennisey, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there's no such hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the objective functions -- the behaviors of the brain -- and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a potentially resident theory, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time I left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental labs, space, time and mass.
They put fundamental laws that government, like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties are not explained in terms of nothing more basic things.
Instead, they're considered fundamental -- and there is the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is already alarm.
In the 19th century, Madame discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of present concepts, space time, time, mass laws, so I put the basic laws of electromagnetic -- and I put the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws government.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas of ideas, space, time, mass charge, then for a matter of logic, you have to pull your list.
The most natural thing would be to put consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path to make it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass processes, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws that are so simple that we can take them into a seal.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can kill them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called passions, "Panis for all of us, "put for mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, the misconstructs, even the microbes of Rob Kennie, the elementary particles.
Even a picture has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or they think.
It's not that a fire can be full of angry when you think "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the roads."
No, so not.
But the thought is that maybe the photons can have some element of raw feeling subject, subjective sensory, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little bit crazy for you.
How do anybody think so crazy to it?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems all the way, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that relate to thinking about physical process, is linking consciousness with information.
There is always information processing, there's consciousness.
Procedure of complexity -- like a human being, complex awareness.
So processing of simple information, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, Gillimen Tony, took this kind of theory and developed it rigorous with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called police, which measures the degree of information in a system.
And I suppose that spike has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information of information, a high degree of pound, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a half a degree of information integration, just quite significant, degrees of pretty important awareness.
But when you get to the laws, microbes, particles, the degree of peak says.
The level of information of information is less, but it's not zero either.
In the Tony theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness, high degrees of pound, high degrees of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that passion can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the equations?
Since the panicable vision of the physics of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of advertising.
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, the panicking vision, has the potential to transfer our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and ethical consequences quite serious.
Some can be illegal.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, so I had to be verbal.
If you're a banking and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of hungry.
I think that thinking about it, this tends to transform your vision, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral consequences, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the Samantha artificial intelligence system in the movie Herbi?
Is it conscious?
According to the vision of panicked information, she has a process of complicated information, integrated, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right -- you have pretty serious ethical problems about the ethic development ethic of intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them.
Finally, you can ask for the conscious collective consciousness, the planet.
Does Canada have its own consciousness.
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED Talk -- right now, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each one?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that needs to be serious.
So this banking vision, it's a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is something fundamental than the second of it is universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally be able to find it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victorian.
I had a very normal profile, an education profile.
I went to school, I got my friends, I was fighting with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to tell me for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She's actually not getting anything.  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a deep profile on my mother's movie, and spent a lot of time looking at the "Steps Sunday and "Dates Creek."
Yes, I know. What controller.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school in Melbourne -- just after about 20 minutes at the top 11 minutes a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you give your speech?
I said, "What discussion?
Well, I had been talking about the law of diagnosis for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your motivation.
When people in wheelchair are talking about inspiring things in school?
"By the way, in the act of acts."
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with people who are disability as an inspiration.
And we are not. And it's not the fault of the guy, it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our manifestations.
We're not real people. We're there to inspire it.
And in fact, I'm on this stage looking at what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting to inspire you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to tell you sticking.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to disability.
Yes, you have sold the lie that disability is a bad thing. A machine, Me machine.
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you great.
It's not bad and it doesn't make it great.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
Or this one: "Your excuse is invented?
Or this one, "Because of learning, interpretation."
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with property legal legs of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the porn term deliberately because they have a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we challenge the disability in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, to motivate them, so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad it is my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But what if you're that person?
I have lost the account of the number of times that have gotten me strange to me to express that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this happens before my work had a public profile.
It was like I'm happy to wake up the morning and remember my own name.  And this is to code.
These images, those images are challenging people with disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as disabled person is actually something difficult.
We used some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term "profit people -- deliberately because I am suffering to call the social model of disability that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very angry with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned how to take the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their capacity.
So is it really fair to do it in the way we do it, by sharing those pictures?
When people say, "You're a source of inspiration -- it says as a conference.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lying, because this lie has been sold that disability makes us great.
And honestly doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here driving the inspiration and you think, "Oh God, are you not sometimes inspired by something?
And actually, I know I am.
Learning from other people with disability at all times.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
I learned that it's a great idea to use a little bit of barrier pieces to collect the things that they fall off.  And I learned the trick of how to load the battery phone battery on the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that is exciting and counted.
I really believe that that lie that we've sold about disability is the biggest inequality.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote, "The only disability in life is a bad attitude," the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a side of stairs has never done that it becomes a graph.
Never.   Sunday to a television screen will not make the substitutions for deaf people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and throwing a positive attitude to convert all those books into the barrier.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching "Budget the Valley Sultauga doesn't consider anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we're happy to get rid of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genetic achievement of people with disability and I want to live in a world where a 11 degree boy in a high school school is not a little surprising that his new teacher is a wheelchair use.
disability doesn't make us exciting, but to question what you think you know about what you do to do it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football, with empathy?
And what is the middle speed of a glacier without charge?
Unfortunately, I just answer one of those questions, so please don't be disappearing.
When people think about augmented reality, think about Minister Republic and at Tom Craig driving hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happens because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the rather graduated reality?
The first step, it's what I take poster, the Google Glass.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google Glass, a device that allows them to see what I see.
Let me experience what is a professional sports in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is to run through the game camp at 100 miles, the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man from 110 pounds are persuadized, trying to tell us with all of its being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's nothing nice.
I bring some videos to show you what's going to use the Google Glass, under the helmet and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the NDA practices, because the idea of the NGO of emergent technology is a submarine coming up to the surface. But -- we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Kle: Come on.
It's horrible to be decoded.
A moment. Let's take a little bit.
Preserved?
Go!
Chris Kle: As you can see, it's a probability of what is to be documented in the football field, from the perspective of the talk.
You may have realized that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, the University of Washington University.
Marcha of field, Richards 54. Rites 45."
Blue eight, Blue 8." Go!
Chris Kle: This is a little bit more about the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being at NASA.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and have asked me in YouTube and on Twitter, "You can see from the angle of a field marital of field.
Or a correct?
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Glass, how do we get from falling? How do we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called Europe Rich, which surely many of you already know.
The Rice Rice has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not bad warm.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh.
No, no, no. I don't want to go on playing? No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CC: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain eating for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we recorded a video from Adrian Peters crossing the line, getting rid of a taxi with the arm before they run and make an anti-computer? What is a fan experience.
When I could be Me running through the song, launching the bullet in the bottom of the network? Or Foreford doing a ship in Wikipedia?
What will be their experience when it descends from a mountain to over 100 miles as an Olympic schedule?
Maybe they increase the sales of the diapers for adults.
But this is not yet augmented reality.
It's just virtual reality, R.A.
How do we achieve augmented reality, RA:
We will achieve augmented reality when the coaches and the marriages and the owners look at the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win parties?
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here is a brief rate about technology at NASA.
In 1965, the Parks of Baltimore put a wrist to their face of field to play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NASA put radio in the hull of the fields of field and after the defense.
They had more speech because it was faster, more entertained.
In 2013, imagine you're going back to your group and you see his next player shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you take possible. You don't have to worry about forget a player.
Or to memorize the strategy.
Just go on the field and react to it.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose parties.
If you lose parties you wake up as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a huge strategy manual.
augmented reality is also a way of collecting information and using it in real time to improve your way of playing the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the sands of the hull and the algorithms, something that's already working.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will be able to send it.
The bad ones will have information.
This will differentiate the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your rewards, and data analysis will stop being just for nerves.
It will be also for sports. Who would have imagined it?
How would it be in the countryside.
Imagine that they are the marriage of field.
You get the ball and back.
You look for an open receptor. All of a sudden, a flower on the left side of your bombsight will warn you that a defense behind you is going to attack you, normally you wouldn't see it, but the RNA system is advanced you.
Go to the protection area.
Another flower is advanced to you that there's an open receptor.
You toss the ball, but you were slowly.
And the bullet loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in his bombsight an area of grass.
It's appropriately, it grabs the ball, running and anonymous.
The audience is coming up and fans have followed the player from every angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the particular.
So I'll make lots of people look at it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
Reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of augmented reality.
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus like our usual entrepreneur?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for the sports leaders.
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much this technology is worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a abuse how hell are their actions from the perspective of victim?
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how does it be completely?
How much is it also worth for a Hambia Community or a New Zealand Testile trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than stress notes and Karasan?
Ladies and gentlemen, reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions that we take and the challenges that we face and the challenges that we face, they depend as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was recently retire after 23 years of service at the High Pacific Patentry.
Most of those 23 years I spent the southern end of the Maria County County, which includes the Goldman Gate.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known by its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Gold Gates Bridge was open in 1973.
Joseph Streets, engineering chief to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically to superintelligence test.
So suicide from the bridge is not practical or probability."
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been identified as such, so that the each from it releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under clean your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which they prefer vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that don't usually get any strange in the water independently, and then they drowned up.
I don't think that the people who are contemplating this method of suicide will realize the death of death that they will face.
This is the cables.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 parallel papers on the bridge.
This is where most people are going to go before the life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at your darkest moment, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an official contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the bank.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We struggled to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who are contemplating suicide, but the officers as well.
We've run a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new offices.
This is Jason Garban.
I met it in July 22 last year when I got a call of a substantial subject sitting on the heart near the center.
I said, and when I came in, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the Goldman Gates.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason Japan, he asked us if we knew the story of the Panderium box.
And I remember Michael Michael, Zero created Pandor, and he sent her to the Earth with a box, and he said, "Well, you never open that box.
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pank, and she opened the box.
From her they came out, penis, and all kinds of evil against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no hope."
They stopped a few instincts, leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind of nice and smart boy in New Jersey just removed life.
I talked to the days of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
Jason parents had asked him.
The colored damage of suicide affect a lot of people.
I ask these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved that one?
What would you say?
Do you know what to say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk about, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't discuss, or bulbs, or tell the person you know how they feel, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the point of inflection you need.
If you think somebody is suicide -- you don't have fear to face them and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: Others in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their life, have you had these thoughts, right?
Confidence the person in front of it can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to look, despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to improve. Impossible, believe that there is nothing you can do about it, a recent social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
And I came up with this talk just a couple days ago, and I got an email of a lady and I'd like to read her letter.
She lost his son at January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read them.
"Hi, Kevin -- I think you're in the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to foot this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite inspiring, but I know more moments of realizing that Mike will really not go home.
Mike was driving from Peter to San Francisco to see the 40-year-old party with his father in January 19.
He never got there.
I called the police of Pethala and I reported it as a disappear that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to 150 in the late day of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before bad without suffering a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with me for your struggle.
The Guinner, the Gold Gallon Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a center.
Good luck this week, Victoria."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man where I mean hope and value.
On March 11, 2005 responded to a radio call for a possible subject on the side of the bridge near the north tower.
I drove my engine down and looked at this man, Kevin Berlin, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the barrier, and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and a half, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided by his account that day will come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, I happy.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that made you go back and give the hope and life another opportunity?
And do you know what he told me?
He said, "You listen.
And let me talk to you and just hear it.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to read them.
"Dear Mr. British, nothing will erase the events of the 11th, and you are one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was climbing for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly medicine.
I adopted Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those heartbeat traits but because of God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We gave God for you.
Just in debt with you, Naviance Bertine."
And at the end she wrote, "Pay when I visited the General Hospital of San Francisco that night, you figure out like the patient.
"I know I had to solve it."
Now, Kevin is an active father and an active member of society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with hope that his story will inspire others.
Succession is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was supported with poison.
That act, despite finishing its own pain, I stole the opportunity to meet it.
This is what the suicide does.
For most suicide people, or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about taking another person.
They just want your own pain to go.
Usually this is actually achieved in three ways, sleep, drugs or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and supercomputer calls around the bridge.
In those incidents I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason one.
The other one was a man I talked about about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three times.
In the final approach, he looked at me, and he said, Kevin, sorry, but I have to go."
And it jumped out.
Horrible, absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to focus on that bridge are not supposed to support.
Also, those few people who have jumped out of the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they left the barrier realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect Marine with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be striving for doing.
Succession can be prevented.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question is marketed, how do you become that?
I must be a unique thing in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way, no way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had since a child.
My foreign finally controlled with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I'm going to give you a bit later, when I look at this picture -- I think, you get Germany, you get it, you go.
But the October, I discovered that -- I am starting to find out.
We all have our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of liberation, to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of the skin or for the beliefs of who around us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo -- which is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this enemy is called reveal.
This is mine.
They recorded me as a "Child when I was born because of the appearance of my genius.
I remember my five years in the Philippines in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in your head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always take that shirt in your head?
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl.
I knew how to be authenticity.
The gender has always considered an immune fact, but now we know that, really, it's something more complex and mysterious, actually.
Because of my success, I never dare to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be bad, but why the world is all about us who want to liberate them.
Every day I managed to be female.
I have mom and dad and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess goddess of the kids.
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries competed.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something would beat me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I still met this woman called Thailand.
It's the director of a transgender beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the beauty competition?
He told me that if she participated she was putting away from the spending of the sensitivity and the vertical spaces, and that night, he won on a toilet suit, won on a gas suit, and she was a third end between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was a beauty of transportation of transportation women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of the campaigns, especially when we traveled to remote provinces from the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom had moved to San Francisco, and he called me and told me that they passed my security from the green card that I could go live to the U.S.
I was resided.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm slipping.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a bear repeat."
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "Do you know that if you move to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of gender?
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I would put two and my name.
She also accompanied me when I was operating in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand they perform the most prestigious surgeries and sophisticated and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to make surgery before they changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or power to get a trial, but for me it was the license to live, to feel dignity.
Suddenly, my fears saw minimality.
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of America Newton Man.
A young woman in New York who lived in his truth, but that was destroyed, he ended up in his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November, we do a global surveillance for the Democratic Day of Transparents.
I'm in this stage thanks to a long history of people who fought and stood up to the injustice.
These are Marshall P. Johnson and Sylvia River.
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help others live their truth without shame.
I'm here, exposing so that some day there is no more vase in November 20.
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Are you going to do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Katanin Schoolin. German, a quick question.
Germany Rockett: Sure. You see, first, thank you with all my bendatorials.
For my support network, my parents especially to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been attending to young women who are trying to do, that I've ordered and sometimes when they call me and told me that his parents couldn't accept it. I would take the phone, I called my mom and said, "Mommy, you can call this woman?
Sometimes it works, other not. It's just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all get a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes that sandwich is not sweet, and that there should be a space that allows people to address and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The trans movement is starting to compare to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understood it.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. GG: Thank you.
In many patterns and tribal societies, parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Malai started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007, and when they were handled their efforts in 2011, when they were taking care of the National Prize June of peace, it became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of injustice -- inequality, violence and exploration.
You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when a child is born, their birth is not celebrated.
It's not bank, not for his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes to the mother and no one happy to the father.
And a mother is a lot overwhelmed by having a girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When I give birth to the second daughter, it concepts it, and with the hope of a son, when it comes up his third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the mother suffers, but the daughter -- the daughter necessarily becomes, when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, he stays home and the school admitted to his brothers.
At the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
It can be fun.
It can play with his friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when I go into the teenager, when I was 13 years old, it was provided to go out of his house without a male accommon.
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you transfer the code of that consumer consumer, you could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor code, not only affect the life of a guy, also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother sacrifice the joy of their life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a single norm of the pattern societies called ability.
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very summerse.
It's the criteria.
The model of a good girl must be scaled.
It's supposed to be quiet and accept the decisions of your father and your mother and the choices of the elderly -- even if you don't want.
If you married it with a man who doesn't like it, or if you marry an old man, you have to accept it, because it doesn't want to be television television.
If the very young house has to accept it.
Otherwise, they will call it the debate.
And what happens at the end?
In words of a poet -- "The killer, the Shrit and then gives birth to more children and daughters."
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, including the same lesson of obesity to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to its children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
You loved brothers and sisters, when Malai, and for the first time, believe me, I didn't like the recent backs, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt very honored to me.
And so much before I was born, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a legendary struggle of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malay de Madagascar, and I called my daughter like that.
But when I lost me, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I brought a line from my name, and I wrote, "Malaria."
And when she grew up, when she was four and a half years old, I admit her in my school.
You wonder, why should I mention the administration of a girl in a school?
Yes, I should mention it.
You can give it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in the patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of girls.
And you can show in a school means the recognition of your identity and your name.
An admiration to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised two weeks before, when I was able to put the heart of the Canadian video, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the left of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in no document.
That was the reason why I value my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters not to his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the health of my daughter.
I was encouraging to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I encourage them to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to instill them in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for Malai.
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for embarrassment.
I taught my daughters, teaching students, to forget the lesson of the obesity.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called selection.
We loved brothers and sisters, we fought more rights for women, and we fought to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called Taliban.
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all political activity, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use vegetables and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silent, the shorted girls and the killed singers were killed.
They suffered millions, but a few talking, and it was terrifying to have those people who kill and argue when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
In the age of 10 years, Malai stood up and raised for education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog, offered himself for the New York Times documentary documents, and he talked on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was spread as a clock around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and the October nine of 2012, they were shooting on the head.
It was a scary day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was depressed between life and death, whispering the ear to my wife, "Should I blame what happened to my daughter, your daughter?
And instantly he said to me, "Please don't blame you.
Defined the right cause.
You put your life on play for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter is inspired in you and joined you.
Both of them were on the right path and God protect it."
These words meant a lot for me, and I couldn't ask again.
When Malai was in the hospital and had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was spread through my wife's face.
But my daughter never complained it.
And I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, and with the excitement in my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please don't worry.
It was a consult for us, and we were considered.
We loved brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I am pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women and women -- it's like any 16 year-old girl.
It cried when it doesn't end up his task.
It fights with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's about special in my tutor that has made so audacious to Malai so brave and expressive and economics?
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was operated from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Moodera group of Google, where I've had a divide to my car, the Google X visualization -- but all the work that I'm talking about today here about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you join a brain operation.
Are you still as smart or not?
If you wouldn't be that, you could be intelligence?
After neuroscience, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the personal part of the center that creates important hormones and neurosciences.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much it would take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them, to follow life.
More than one time I've saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of experimentation, so I decided that I would experience to try to get the optimal doses because there is really no clear map that says it in detail.
I started testing with different mixed, and I was surprised to see how small changes in the doses changed dramatically my structure, my sense of who I was, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemicals for a man of seven, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always funny, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions attacked.
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be a robot.
In fact, I was trying to have a little bit of an insect, to fix a problem that had the front, and it just doesn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my doses.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to go through -- since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do -- when I adjust those hormones and neurosciences and so on, I was to reclaim my intelligence after disease and operation, my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I tend to think almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how do I get those mental images that I use to create protections, my ideas, if you want to make new ideas and recreating situations.
This kind of thinking is not new.
philosophers like Human, Descartes and Johnson see things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are those who question this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind works, for me it's simple, for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative and reverse thinking.
So after several years, I will find the point right and I have lots of great mental means, really vivid money, well sophisticated and well.
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the front of it?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments that are done by two groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan made by Giosis Gansan and their colleagues from Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The media column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as it was imagined by seeing that same image.
The column on the right is created by restoring the control of the central column on the left of the left column -- you see that the difference is almost nuts.
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost nuts.
Now, let me share another experiment. This is the Jack Gallon lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert the brain waves into recycling visual fields.
Put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were hiding their brains to create a great steel reactions of the brain to video sequences.
Then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while it was so much recorded a new scale.
The computer, using only the brain information of the scan that I decided to show you what it seemed that the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the drugs of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us together.
We're right close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same picture, you believe in the brain the same map.
This was conducted with the brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution became increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes electronics.
I don't offer to that.
Many are proposing new processing techniques for images -- even me -- telling us with the recent result of the MRI first, we should ask ourselves the next thing, this technology will be the end of the road.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, larger magnets only offer small improvements in resolution -- not increase for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger images, we make better magnets better.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort at MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in relationship of illegal and brilliant solutions in coding. And decorating in the traditions and radio frequency receptor receptors in the MRI systems.
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field, we use magnetic patterns followed to the Franklin radio frequencies.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the FDA frequency process, we can actually increase the information that can be extracted in a single scale.
In addition, we can then divide our knowledge in layers of the structure of the brain and the memory to create increase in the thousands we need.
By using the IRA we should be able to measure not just the fluid blood fluid but the hormones and neurosciences that I've mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly by thinking about it?
What would we be able to do?
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irrespective to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's cure and similar diseases.
We have a few choices more than opening this door.
Anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that I'll take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just gay closet.
I think we all have guns.
Your closet, maybe it is to tell some person for the first time that I love it or tell someone who's pregnant or say to someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you've gone through in life.
Every stroke is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary tremendously -- the experience of having lived in and out of that anger is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side Walin Washington, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of life intelligence intensity, not to run my algorithms, to quote the letters of Ann Di France as a letter.
And I will be blessed that by the hill of my short pants and I had adapted my head to a little bit, and I would usually ask me a little child, and I said, "Hey, are you a boy or girl?
And it would appear an uncomfortable silence on the table.
I would take my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a radio leave.
The father was advanced by the newspaper and the mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and I would boil around inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised the next time I would say something.
I would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"Are you a guy or a girl?
A family silence, but this time I was prepared and was about to get filled in the female issues on the table --  I had the dates of Betty French.
The quote of Global Steven.
Even a fragment of the "coming "material I would show you.
So I breathe up and down my eyes and my backs a four year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist dream, just a girl with a question, "Are you a kid or girl?
So I breathe back again, I stood up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confused.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I see a kid, but I'm a girl, and I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more than kind of girl from a comfortable piece."
And that little girl looked at me and paying attention, and he said, "My favorite piece is raped and has a fish.
Can you give me a pancreatic, please?
And that's it. Just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the pancreatic that I asked for it?
It was the easiest difficult conversation of everything ever had.
And why? Because the piece of the gang and I, both of us were honest with each other.
So as a lot of us, I've lived in some of us in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be an architect.
But inside the dark, you can't know what color the walls are.
You just know how one feels like living in an armed.
This is how my anger is not different than you or you or your own.
And surely, I'll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet, it was harder than coming out of it, but this is the thing: how hard it is not relative.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell someone who has been able to explain to someone who have taken in a restaurant bank is more difficult than saying it's been departed?
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your five year-old son that you're going to divide?
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop clicking what is difficult to what is difficult to the other person to make us feel better or worse relative to our closet, and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in armed, and they may be able to make security, or at least safer than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, that no matter what their walls are made of, a stroke is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine itself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail, a dress.
It was not the military letters ready to fight any four year-old children who would enter the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, accepted in a corner of my dark arm by starting my great gay graduate, and it will just move a muscle is the most scary thing ever ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to be able to disappoint it, and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that big, I'll kill you.
One of my most memorable largest languages was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the people in the invited knew that I was gay, and when I did my honor ladies -- in my black dress and tons, I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who met me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women screamed.
And the gay story battle had started.
"Hey, did you ever be in the Carder?
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San Francisco.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's familiar."
"Hake, meet my estate Attenda?
It's very good and never talked about having a novel."
"Hall, what is your favorite TV program.
Our favorite program? Will and Grace program.
And you know who loves us? Jack did.
Jack is our favorite."
And then a woman, described but in waiting to show desperately his support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said basically, "Well, sometimes my husband uses pink sharks.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the landscape launches.
It might have been easy to indicate where they felt loved.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were forced.
And what else can you ask someone, but do you expand?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic you get.
It's like the hard conversations are still not my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have come out.
But I'm getting better, and I know what I like to call the three principles of the Pacific Girl.
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but they understand that what it implies out of any stroke is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take the armed. Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe had no armor, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be general, others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be directly. Just give it to you. Ran your parks.
If you know they're gay, give it to you.
If they say to their parents that might be gay, they might keep hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more importantly,  leave the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You just apologize for that.
And some of you can get safe wounds -- you know what you've done, but you never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel decentralized, but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a drawing closet, you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, Bollywood. Enjoy the salad.
intelligence, what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen, an example of productive experiment has been the famous quote of Edge Distribution that the question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can save it.
When Edgar Dictators wrote this as a critical to computer pioneers like Alan Turing.
And so, a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
First we start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or neuroscience of the Earth or the Earth non-violence, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorists, we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that you don't know about this, that you don't have any concept about the intelligence of Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that demand the surface of a single planet just stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I took a number of years ago, I analyzed a variety of topics through science, through various disciplines that they were, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology for example, for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in robotic movement planning there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and putting them together together, I said, for a number of years, there is a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different questions?
Is there just an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent to an and a mile for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open choices, with a force T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, to an impending future time that we have.
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay through it.
intelligence tries to maximize the freedom freedom of action and maintaining open options.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How predictable is it?
Is the level of human intelligence?
Is artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or "the entropy," in their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that technician consumer connection between entropy and insections is a deeper relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with long-term entropy production, but actually emerges directly from it?
To figure out, we've developed a software engine called England, designed to maximize long-term entropy production in any system that is in the inside.
Amazingly, entertainment could spend multiple animal intelligence, playing human games, and even earning money by trading action, all of this without that they had been doing that.
Here are some examples of English in action.
Just like a human foot without falling up, here we see English balancing a counter using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entertainment a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the position.
This balance of equilibrium will have applications for human robotics and human assistance.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate ourselves from extremes of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that English can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
And the entrepreneur is widely applicable to a variety of dominant.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game game against itself, lighting its potential for play.
So here we see English to orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and keep success the well connected network.
This same network of network organizing also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see English organizing the routes of a ship fleet -- discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, English is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see English spontaneously discovering and execute a strategy of burning, selling in a simulated series of action negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under its experimental management exponentially.
This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance, and in sure.
Alex Wisdanis, what you've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all derived from a single equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony here.
So let's go back at the beginning of the use of the robot, the "African play, there was always the concept that if we developed smart machines, there would be a cyber report.
The machines will be lifted against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of cyber rebellion to the winter.
It's not that the first machines become smart and then mathematics and they try to get rid of the world.
It's all the opposite -- that the impulse of taking control of all the future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals that are getting rid of this kind of framework?
My equivalent to that statement to help us build artificial intelligence, or to help us build artificial intelligence, or to help us understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a point of inflection in human history, something between the confinement of stars and losing the planet we call home."
Although, over the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting around other stars, which means that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the full standard intensity of stars when the planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
Instead, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocket planets like the Earth's land planets, and also the amount of light they get from their sun.
At the same time, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this theory of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is warming under the weight of humanity.
The year 2011 was the most hot record.
Glaciers and marine ice that have been with us for us from a million now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have rapidly overcome.
But I'm not a climate scientist, no astronomy.
But I study the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
It could be said to look for alien opportunities in the industrial sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe can tell you that the more you look for planets similar to Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited to a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rocket and despite being a little further from the Sun, you can consider a potentially habitable world showing this by a mission like Kepler.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our rooms like the "Ruley raised their surface to search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit the orbit, like the Molas mission, take samples from the Martian atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has lost their ability.
private companies now offer a short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all these Mars images remind us to the desert of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and the ideas and pieces in comparison with Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the desert areas of our planet that are still going to be collapsed, really extracted places in comparison with Mars.
Even in the most dry and more elevated places on Earth the air is fresh and full of oxygen excluded by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement of Mars and other land planets have a big and sad show, the implications and belief of some that Mars will expect to save us from this infrastructure of the only planet that we know is really satisfaction, the Earth.
For a lot that I like the international exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to save humanity is like imagining that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party actually will have a place later in the wild boat.   Thank you.
But the targets for the international exploration and the land preservation is not controlled.
No, they are actually faces of the same currency. The goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world like alien panels.
They just find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile and unconscious areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment, the Fermi paradox.
Many years ago, the physicist Fortune Ferry asked the question that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life existence until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become enough advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are to protect the origin of the planets that put this development.
It's arrogant to think that only international colony will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and international exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to subject the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve ability on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I used my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had left them.
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows and they were all right.
I thought about calling a card, at least I had my cell phone, but in the midnight, a surgeon could take a long time to come in, and I was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was experimenting from my passport and my suitcase.
It would be expensive, but sure that I didn't get more expensive than a drop at a half night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, it works well on.
I'm a neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
It releases cortex that increases heart rhythm, modulated the levels of adrenaline and the thinking.
And when I got to the factory show in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started wondering, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in place, that prevent bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, that minimize the probability that it's a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't criticized.
I was having my colleague Danny Kambir, won from the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called prostitute restriction.
It's something he had learned from the psychologist Gary Klein who had written from this a few years before, known as the prime present.
Everybody knows what the pressure is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the prime, as Danny explains Daniel, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, and you try to figure out what can do to prevent things happen, or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a prime.
Some of them are evidence, others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, I will trigger a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis -- based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hypothesis, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a sense of the location of important things, where the good is, where the fish are, that locates fruit trees, where the friends are living and enemies.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that will be used in the London taxis.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the operating sense of the shoes and yet you could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing car keys, reading and passion glasses.
So at home they have a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For his passport, a particular cancer.
For your reading glasses, a particular table.
If they spend a place and they are entrepreneurship with it, their things will always be there when they look for them.
What about the journeys?
Take a picture of a picture of his credit card, and they take a driver of driving, passion, send it for email to themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or steal them, this can facilitate sustainability.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases corrupt.
Cortus is toxic and entrepreneurial thinking.
So part of the practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems in your site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is set up as a protest for all decision-making, and in fact for financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you need to take that you would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit."
They all know that the high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, attack the heart, the brain spill.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the color, a statistic."
And maybe you've heard about the statues, and you know that it's one of the most recycled drugs in the world today -- even likely you know people to take them.
So you think, "Yes, record the status."
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistics that you should ask for most doctors don't want to talk about, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for NASA, the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the NASA?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or join a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of desk statistic is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor would not recommend something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's guilty of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the underlying mechanisms.
But the estimates of Glamoty that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely recycled statue -- what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300 300 percent.
This according to the research of Chinese Renewabbit and Patro Harvard, confirmed independently by Bloba.
I explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, it would spill brain or another adverse event.
You may think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my cholesterol will be done.
Why not? Doctor? Give me the recipe anyway.
But then you have to ask for a statistical statistic, and it is, "Get out of the side effects -- right?
For this particular drug, side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things -- defeat muscle pain and artificial pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the medicine."
But a moment.
Remember that under stress they don't think of clarity.
So think about how you would take this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped him, five percent of 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get rid of the drug that you can help your medicine.
I don't say they should or not take the state.
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the beginning of informed consent principles.
We have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to be quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men of 50 -- expression of the prostate of cancer, the number needs to treat is 49.9.
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has help.
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the importance or encryption disability, investment, radical grade, recent landscape, food.
And if you have luck, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just one year or two.
So the idea of prime is to think about before the questions that you can pretend to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this whole thing in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator is not necessary to the digestive system, or the book or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react with quickly. They could be the lunch of lions -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out of window during those moments of stress is rational logical thinking like Danny Kamman and their colleagues have shown it.
So we have to train to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all definitely.
We're all going to fail every time in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those failures might be, to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
Rebuing the night of snow in Montreal in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed me a combination of combination next to the door, with a key door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered -- and lots of messages that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized -- but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Piano, "Ph is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing superintelligent.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a "Ph in the score, you need to play more superintelligent.
Two percent, even more subject.
Four percent, extremely soft state.
This is my drawing of a tree tree, there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of dollars may be, you may never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence, a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the AIDS, besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs language came over the 1980s, and over the time of time, it's mixed with local signs, and it developed the language that we now know as ALS.
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born deaf, and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they are really in my mind every day.
As a deaf person living in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, used, behaviors and norms without questioning them.
So how do you understand the sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my heat and amplify sound.
I learn and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people respond to.
So I learned, for example.
"Don't stop the door."
"Don't make a lot of noise when you eat the ball of paper papers."
"Don't educate, and when you're eating, you make sure not to throw the covers on the plate."
All this is called "sorry "street."
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm a super-like superstrict.
And I'm always waiting with the sound of the sound, which is about to come next.
So, this drawing.
TED, for deciding it.
TED, for continuity.
TBP, for announcing.
You can see that the picture has no notes in the lines.
That's because lines already contain sound through subtle bottles and standards.
In deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for paradigm at the ALS.
A typical picture has five lines.
However, to me, to do the self with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic resistance there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painting.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the attention.
There was no visual art, everything was audience.
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
Am I going to tell you more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it a tactile way, or experience it visually or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and integrate it in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me as much as sound, I decided to leave it and turn it.
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control, social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was oblivious -- it was something from an ear person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could well debate me and my artistic job, or I could buy me.
I chose to be started.
There's a massive culture around spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as much as and become my voice.
And so I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different interruptions from ALS.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you borrow their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I wouldn't continue with this practice, I feel that I could get away in the forgotten and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium, deep in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and ALS.
For example, a musical note you can't capture and express in the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept at ALS.
The two are very space and highly modulated that means that subtle changes can affect all of the signs as much as sounds like sound.
I'd like to share a metaphor of the piano, so they understand better how the AIDS works.
So, imagine a piano.
The ALS is divided in many different geometric parameters.
If you assign a different parameters for every finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the body movement -- the speed, the speed of your hand, and so while you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it's just a keyboard at once.
However, the AIDS is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a similar form to express a clear concept or idea at ALS.
If only a keyboard would change the corner, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of tone and time and volume.
In AIDS, by using these different geometric parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the sign for fire in that."
This is the show of fish on that."
I'm looking at you.
Look at it.
Oh, I was shocked.
It's Oh.
What are you looking at?
Oh, so ...
So I started thinking, and if I look at the AIDS through the lessons of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeated it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of "The Day," the sun comes out, and it gets over.
This is all the day."
If you repeat it and reduce speed, you visually look like a musical piece.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can tell you all night."
"All night.
This is all night, in this picture.
And this led me to think about about three different types of nights, "Okay, for the night?  All night."
I feel that the third has more musical than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in ALS and how the distance to the body can express changes over time.
For example, one hero. It's a hand, two hero. It's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a long time."
Then, "Startup -- "Ahadin and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time.
Common Time is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per capita.
However, when I see the word "money that I think automatically I think of the same time."
Look at MD: right hand, MR: left hand.
We have the penture through the head and the chest.
(Audience: (Mexico, father father -- "Mom Command -- "The Pickless, E, fat fat. I'm going to show you a form of my hand called "Father Father."
Can you do it with me?
All with your hands.
Now we're going to do it as much in the head as the chest, something like common time."
Yeah, very good.
That means "I would say "In the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second I would like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means "Congoint at the ALS.
Now, the third one. Please get me back again.
And again.
It's lighting at ALS.
We're going to do the three together.
"And "she said, "Congo, colonizing and lighting."
Good work.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. But they transmit very different meaning.
It's amazing to see how the AIDS is alive and preserve, just like music.
However, today, we live in a very audience world.
And just because the ALS has no sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start to question what the social value defines and allow the ALS to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn AL: Not that you have to hear to learn music.
The ALS is a rich teacher, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Deng Karasan: Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can hide it all, but then you have to wipe it up.
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocent bubble or an ignorance bubble -- I should say, because adults lied to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also entertain and they are not very good at cleaning other people's ones.
The time happened now, I'm an adult and teaching citizen and invention at Harvard Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk on the beach.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the beach, and no, it's not booking alcohol, and if you are, I didn't have it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something spectacular.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic bits to study them under the microscope, and we classify them and we collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats.
So together with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream of inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this work with an advanced high job so that the very low kids can participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragility.
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to combine them in something that we hope that works.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we just collect information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this plastic -- the children are really excited about robots.
And then we quickly created what we call a prototype."
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we end before lunch.
And we transform light and web cameras in access and we assemble it in a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see plastic bits floating slowly through the sensor while the board computer process process this image and measure the size of each particle to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this invention step on a website for inventors called "Buddhism, with the hope that someone else is even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and boom, they're trying to fix it immediately.
I can investigate my local problem, but my students at Hong Kong are very well informed kids.
You see the news, you get the Internet, and you get together with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning an oil spill, just using hands, in Santa, the largest breast forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that drink, it's the water that they get made, the water where they fish, the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and oil is also brown color, and when it all mixed up, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called space, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a spectrum that can be released through all sorts of substances that produce different species, which can help identify what's in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can investigate a problem to distance -- I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further -- maybe address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they spread several giant waves, called tsunami, and those tsunami destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant as well.
And today, according to reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has control traces by 1997.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure Franklin radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, of course, has a safe thing, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to Fulfish every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course we didn't take them, parents didn't allow them.
But every night we report to the control center, here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with radicalization all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data collected that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategy, the initiative, etc.
And to do this, we created a rudimentary map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the elevation map, we introduced pieces to represent data in real time of radiation, and we rotate water to simulate rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust was filtering from the top of the mountain to the river system to the radio system in the ocean.
It was a rough estimate.
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom up to 1.5 miles from nuclear center, and with the fishermen of the area we were collecting seconds from the sea milk with a secret of sediment as we invented and we build.
Here we see a progression. We've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of it, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal -- chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optic -- basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where kids are able to become reality with adult aid, and where adults can be kids again.
Students, acceleration. All acceleration.
I'll be Harvard. We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help the mobility of advanced age complexity transforming its standard wheelchair cells into new electrical vehicles.
Platform, oil and radiation are terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect children from horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientific citizens, creators -- surveys, we have to prepare the next generation to worry about environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin computers, two radically opposite designers.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk story.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One is imposing about the environment, the other one creates it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for her.
Michelangelo mind said that when he looked at the brain in blue, he saw a figure that struggled for being free.
The fifth was unique tool of Milky Angele.
But living beings are not centered.
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information required it for every cell to work and to replicate it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by range of manufacturing and mass production.
The mountain lines have dictated a world made out of parts by taking the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects as a shame of discrete parts with different functions.
But you don't find any smartphones of hormone material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with diagnosed pieces.
The skin skins are more thick with small pores in the back.
You act primarily as a filter, the other primarily as a barrier, and yet, it's the same skin, no parts, no statues.
It's a system that would vary their functionality through the value of alligator.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architect to work today between the middle and the gene, between machine and organism, between the shame and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis -- is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions out of the world, moving away from self-assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why wasn't this possible about 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they connect four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools across scale, of large-scale scale, like this robotic arm with a 24-year-old scope of diameter with a solar basis that some day not very far to print full buildings, and graphs of nanoticity made genetically modified microbial microscopes that shine in the dark.
Here we have reinvent the challenge, an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every opening is unique to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt -- this was for a fashion deficit from Paris with Iran van the Herbie van -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, running in the sites, flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D 3D printing collaborator, we printed this layer and fake 3D without courses between cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and soft materials in the resolution of 20 miles.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CD scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution analytical and synthetic instruments, allows us to design products that adapt not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues as well.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the same time structure, comfortable and also absorber sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator -- went back to nature to inspire us, and by designing this profit of surface surface, it becomes a substantial.
We print this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in richness, open and color, correspond to pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, would vary its functionality not through the addition of another material or another shame, but very carefully and delicated material property.
But is the ideal nature?
Are there parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Hebrew Bible, and one of them came up and got a lot of what matters me.
As she relates, "In the third day of the creation, God sent the Earth to grow a fruit tree crashed of fruit."
For that first fruit tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches and leaves and fruit.
All the tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made trees grow with branches with sheets, cortex, tails and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if the objects were made of one piece of piece?
Are we going to go back to a better state of creation?
So we look for the biblical material, the kind of material of fruit tree with fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant biomass on the planet is called little letters, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs and schools and mariles.
We thought that if we could synthesize their properties, we could generate multinational structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal marketing.  We asked a bunch of shells of shrimp, and we put them up and we produced small shooting.
Looking at chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and opaque, to light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the large-scale structures, a system was built with multiple pockets of controlled corruption controlled.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single material three meters long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural form of the contact with the air.
So why are we still designing playing?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microbes that appear for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we increase bacteria designed genetically to capture very rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that are doing their transition without sample problems, and if it gets even more, to windows.
A fruit tree crashed of fruit.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of charges of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part -- for objects designed to broadcast them, put the marine life, and put on the ground, help grow a tree.
The adjust for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We look for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain the life for the international trip.
To do that, we need to dominate bacteria and control their flow.
Just as the periodic table, we made our own elements of elements -- new forms of life created complexity and advanced way of biological form.
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid ancestor, only instead of transforming precious metals -- are synthesized new biological functionality within very small channels.
This field is called microbial.
We print our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothes, two microbial communities.
The first is the circling.
It lives in our oceans and the freshwater standards.
And the second one, E. collective, the bacteria that lies in the human intestine.
You convert the light to sugar, the other sugar consumption and produce useful biofuels.
But these two microbials don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help them flow these bacteria and to alter their road function.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, by looking at the properties of the material on desired function.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we designed more transparent channels.
This police system, when you stretch from one end to another, it goes down 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our thin interest.
And here it is, as a principle at TED, our first public photographer, bright liquid channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shell said, "We're creative creatures, only half is done."
What if design would provide the other half.
What if we could create structures that increase living matter?
What if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, repair the damaged tissue and support our bodies that were born?
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always need to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer print material in layers.
Nature is also known that nature doesn't do that.
It grows up with sociologist.
This community of the worm -- for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which it is metrically.
The fabrication doesn't admit to this level of sociology.
It does it through combination not of two materials, but two proteins in different approaches.
An act as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is first in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts to hide a company of compression.
tension and compression. The two forces of life, they manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we put a small magnet on the head of a seat worm to the hill.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the computer worm company.
However, when I put the silk worm on a flat paper, not within a box, we realized that willing a flat chapter and still metabolizing sandwich.
So we started designing different environments, different animations, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition of the cocoon is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often send the silk worms to death inside their coasters, their silk stands up and used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these plants, we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single chapter.
They were smart saled, and we could create these things.
So we scanned this process to architectural scale.
We had a hunger robot doing silk platforms, and we put ourselves in our site.
We knew that silk worms towards more dark and cold areas -- so we used a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or burborrats, to block the rays of light and heat -- distributing silk worms about structure.
We were prepared to get the origami.
We asked 650 worms of silk to a line of silk online.
And after we feed them four weeks, they were prepared with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the street, and as they were slide, they were straight, they were standing, they put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity and he was right.
The biological silk of the hydrogen silk on the hydrogen silk route, they give all of this personal intelligence.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, 65,000 pounds of silk have 6,000 miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the route of silk.
The polices, after the election, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used by 250 extra pellagrasses in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk thread through a robotic arm, the other empty camps.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two material, designers must bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired in design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we take charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them "What do you want to be more?
If you had to remember what age you had when you asked them for the first time this?
You can show it with your fingers.
three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be far?
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be more of it?
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had too much.
In school I liked English, the materials and the art and developed websites, and I was playing the guitar on a punch band called TV Francisco.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like testing and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of abuse, this feeling of abuse, this is no longer a challenge, it gets redefining.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested in something else, something completely different, and I got on it in it, and I let you absorb and I feel "Yes? I've found my own, and then again that I start to join me.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to focus on that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to convert all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denied all my other passions and rescue me to a carriage.
Another reason why I got so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I worried that there would be something wrong in this, and something bad about me because of anything.
I worried to be afraid of engagement, or being disappeared, or an audience or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I would like to have planned to you then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it, they learned it from culture.
We ask ourselves first, "What do you want to be far?
We have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you get to that age.
It's considered a naive question to provide cute answers in children like, "I'll be astronomy or "Walk "Danch," or "I want to be paralyzing."
They're going to show the Hallenus despair here.
This question is being done over and over again as we grow in different forms of different ways, and so, high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be more of it?
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what sleep takes us off.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things -- even though you really care about you are laughing and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be an art of violence and psychology.
You've got to choose."
This is Dr. Bob Chiles -- and he is antibiotic and psychologist anti.
And this Amy Nerd, age editor became an illustrator, entrepreneur, teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of focused life is very identified in our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real voice, the idea that each of us has something to go on for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who's not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And I'm going to feel that there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a multiplication.
A multinational is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a puffs, so I say.
It could help if it's split in three parts: multiple and potential and day.
You can also use other terms that connect the same idea, as a education, resistance.
During the Reason, the ideal was who was fine in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Sherika refers to us as "Stories."
They use any term they like or invent one own.
It seems to me as a kind of adaptive to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see multiplication as a limitation or limitation that you have to come.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths as being like this.
Here are three multinational supermarkets.
One: ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
So Howard Hawan and Rachel Bioma expressed their shared interests in cancer, data visualization -- travel, mathematics and design, by founding Media.
Medicar is a company that creates a geographically inspired jewelry.
Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his ecological ecologist of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in intersections.
So the new ideas.
And the multiple people, with all their ancestors, can access a lot of these points of interaction.
The second multinational superpower is fast learning.
When the multinational is interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are about to be printing, for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort areas.
A lot of skills are transferred to other disciplines and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area we pursue -- so we rarely started from zero.
Norman Monterey is a full-time journey and independent writing.
As a little girl piano a perfect capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known mechanism.
Before you become a writer, I was a financial planners.
He had to learn the earliest sales mechanics when his practices started, and this ability helps him write compelling launches for editors for the editors for it.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you catch in, even if you end up with it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have anticipated.
The third multinational superpower is adaptation. I mean, the ability to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
Open Carley is sometimes director of videos -- other websites, the web designer designer, sometimes solved by Kickstarter, sometimes teachers, and sometimes apparently James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles -- depending on the needs of their clients.
The magazine Fast Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and unpredictable that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to engage to satisfy the needs of the market, which will actually thrive.
So ideas of ideas, fast learning and adaptation, three skills where the multinational are very happy, and three skills that might be lost if they're prepared to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to foster the multinational ones themselves.
We have complex problems, mutations right now, and we need not conventional creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists in your heart.
They came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be pediatric neurogenesis.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a multiplication mutation.
The specialists can dive in depth and put in practice ideas, and the multinational offers a broad of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that drive with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the multinational people in a large part, they are just willing to be more like their specialized partners.
Once he said this, if there's one thing you get from this talk, I hope it is this: replicate with the inner carbon, whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist, then a lot of the media.
That's where you will give the best of you.
But for the multinational in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes, --  I say, recognize with their many passions.
Keep their curiosity for those contemporary markets.
They explore the interactions.
And embracing our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and more happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, multiple, the world needs us."
Thank you.
In 1914, a woman named Austern led to a psychiatric in French.
It was supportive and couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Alabams.
Alikes didn't know how to help Austern, but I was flying for her, until unfortunately, it was in 1900.
After his death, Alphas did a automotive and found strangers in the Green brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you would have been alive today, we couldn't give her to her more help than Alps gave him 14 years ago.
Alexanders was Dr. Alpha Alzheimer's.
And Austern Determination, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1928, medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infection, a lot of treatments for cancer, antibodies for HIV, states for the cards and much more.
But it has been progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, include many of you.
If you wait to live until the age of 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's going to be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their hands with Alzheimer's or helping care for a friend or being dear with Alzheimer's warm.
In the United States, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in the disease of Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease, and its cost is a five times increase in 2050, as it develops the generation of the baby bomb.
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't prevent or cure or even slow your development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the research of cancer than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's, and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but everybody should say, "The Alzheimer's one disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, everyone -- even scientists, confusing Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be responsive in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there are only to look at a picture of a healthy health brain compared to a patient's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to setting up a loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by the Alzheimer's reducing life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plants and strangers in the Aurora brain a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in paper that are parallel.
And when it folds well, these sticky dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules stand up with each other, forming groups that can form large plates and films.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's brain.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identifying of what step block is complex, like definition a bomb.
I could cut a cable could do anything.
Coordination can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocked it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in the most part, the wires have reduced and waited for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, genes, chemistry, physicists, engineers and mathematics.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside of our lab has seen it yet.
So let's look at a few videos of what happened by testing these drugs in worms.
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick between each other within them, like Alzheimer's humans.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms on an early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 144 years of hope, there's real hope of what can be done in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to make that hope, to beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to tell you that Alzheimer's a disease and that if we try it, we can beat it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have taken more research and exercise on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislation.
That was essential to move in HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, hidden victims, care of their loved ones day and night, are often too desperate to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Austern, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They help speak for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times column of New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by trying to prove it to me one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are released to make 36 and more personal questions, and then both of them look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number 12, if you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would it be?
Number 28: When was the last time you cry to another person?
And right?
As it goes forward, these are increasingly personal.
Number 30, this really likes me -- Tell your partner what excites you from him or she -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled with this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the record that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So I was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also intrigued too.
And when I had a chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to love me.
However, we fell in, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Commanda Loving column a few months later.
That was published in January, and it's now an ambition, so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, are they still they are still?
And the reason I think this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the topic.
A week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book over the last few years, so I had been forced to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends from Facebook and imagine that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that's a good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he said, I had no idea.
The article was published online at night, and already the Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic.
And the Sunday. I've already called the Tomorrow Shoot and the Gordon Monterey America.
In one month, the article received more than eight million views, and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with significant experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were calling or writing, what they did every day for weeks, they were always asking the same question: They still go together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email of my email with the phrase, "Do they still follow together?
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and they asked it.
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage, "Hey Mandela where your neighborhood is?
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the rebuilding of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have covered their own life.
In fact, the New York Times published a complementary article for San Valley, who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse in all this attention was to be very respected with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both would make a public appearance together.
It was recording television interviews, and rescues from photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the infant icons of the love process -- a range for the one I didn't feel at the absolute quality.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really works, or whether it was able to produce perfect love, not just an adventure, but real love, perfectly love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months ago, and I felt, especially that people would pose the wrong question.
How do you know if you follow together or not, and then do it do it?
If the answer was not to do the experience of making these 36 less interesting questions?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for an international approach between college students, using what Aaron called some personal approach, prostitute and recycled.
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
Participants felt closer after doing it. Several studies were also used by the rapid Army protocol of Aron as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of police and community, and they've used it among people of opposite political ideology.
The original version of history, which tried last summer, which combine personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article -- but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small university of liberal art, and then a student approached me and told me with shape, I proved the study and didn't work.
He seemed described for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you love the person with whom you did it?
Well, he made a pause ...
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but did you get better friends.
Do you feel that you were able to get better after testing the study of the study?
The sound.
So, working, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he looked for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled up with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to put all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I went back in science.
I investigate everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could somehow break the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I just investigated for the book I wrote, but in retrospect, it looks really obvious.
I thought that if I was armed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt like that.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more related.
I have more confidence to demand what I'm looking for.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you can reasonably demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is a garden, not just being loved today and being loved today, but to keep being loved by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to fall in.
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the important risk, and this is a very attractive story, because it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that I ask, still follow together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or not.
So more than a question, I would propose that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are complicated? And how do you know when to cut and disappear?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably makes a relationship, or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your partner?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation about what to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's this one, a year ago, a meeting and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we fall in, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But you will fall in love is not the same thing to remain love.
You will fall in love the easy part.
So at the end of my article I wrote, "Love didn't happen.
We stay in love because we take the choice to be.
And I show you a little bit about reading it now, not because it wasn't true, but because at the moment, I had not considered anything that was supposed to do that election.
I don't consider how many times we would have to make that decision, and how long it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing whether he will always choose me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, have chosen to love somebody so generous and total and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe about.
And what I'm looking for, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the ultimate implication in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't really write.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he will love me, and it's terrifying but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lessons on the middle of mountain, and in a certain way, I came as a group of the forest.
New York City is a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I got a dollar ticket -- a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example how we eat the specialists.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a given moment I was in Hawaii -- I like to go from excuse and make South and all those weird things and I was making a colleague for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I threw all the pages and I made a sort of cardilactor cardioves at the Agnes Martin style -- the resident covered and a bee was putting.
Well, my mother has fear of bees and it's allergic to them, so I added more resilience on the canvas, thinking I could hide it.
Instead, the opposite happened, in some way it seemed to go in size, as if it was to look at the text with a magnifying cell.
So what did I do? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs -- strange bottles that I would find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate them and tell stories about these objects.
So I got to draw around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow shot, draw the same way around a dig in the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and I created my own texture of specific specialists.
First of all, botations, you can make an idea.
Then I did some strange insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the resident layers.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to Silicon.
It was great, man.
At some point I'm interested in the human shape, sculptures of natural size residents with human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I died.
I didn't know what to do, because the resistance was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to drawing in a window, then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the region.
So I did this for years, and my common work with something very big, which I call "the Therapistance.
For the "training I was very inspired in "The Development God of Hemisphere Boston who is a painting in the Museum of Prison in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of time.
Well, the tradition. I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of compassion.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, there's Jesus and the languages.
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation to this analogy of analog mesh where they hide.
This is where the creatures with the heads of animals are headed up to the face, ready to spread in mass to track in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised from thousands of elements.
This is a bird boy tied to a laboratory.
Billy Graham is in the sea, the Horizon -- the paradigm pattern of the death -- Waltan, the Osama bin Laden shelter -- there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
And anyway, a kind of a creature.
It's coming out of the ocean, and I spit oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of clouds.
Their hands are like balloons and it looks like a mythological being that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the tradition.
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand I expect.
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a track, like a bird pilot, and you hear clouds of this trail.
It also has a 1980s tail, a set of feet that binds the training.
Anyway, his tail is going to be able to get on a volcano.
I don't know why that happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ends up in a hidden school balloon made by terrorist cards from 1860.
Have you seen them?
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from terrorism.
Very heavy to your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects, you're called "philosophics."
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material being expansively, dictionaries or magazines.
But each act is acting as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they get together, they divide down.
And you can walk between them. I'm taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope button that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the head -- it's the chest.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or ideal, or whatever it has, a kind of anti-computer thing.
It's a quick rate of these work because I can't explain them for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a piece of body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and they enter the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside of the tropical carbon.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called Pinancy Worldwides.
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio, a radio, a radio, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
We lie the box and all the people inside the side with each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you redefine who is and the box you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and genetically we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do?
They take an aspiration.
But so that this pill has an effect against pain, first of the stomach, the interests and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and the signature system so that any drug is running in the body.
The defense, however, is that when you throw it any drug into a diagram.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take antiretroviral drugs, they serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the Camp of CDN cells.
But they're also known for their teenage side effects, mostly negative, because in time they get to the blood current, they get away, and even worse even for the time they take to their fate, which is where it's more important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are brain regions like the lymph glass, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is intimate and it doesn't easily enter the blood stream of patients that are subjected to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of the treatment of HIV with the current drugs that is a life treatment by the oral road.
One day, I sat and thought, "Could we get the treatment directly to the department of the virus, without the risk of disable medicines?
As a scientific expert in lasers -- the answer was in front of me, the lasers of course.
If you use in openness, for the care of wounds and surgery of diabetes, you can use for anything imaginary -- including the extracellular transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes that open and close almost immediately infected cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask yourself, "How is that possible?
We sent a small little laser beam on the cellular membrane of HIV as these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser runs the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in terms of microscopes.
Before you even notice, the hole is immediately replaced.
We're currently testing this technology in vitro or in Palestine plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that possible? You can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make an initiative in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, goes into the site of infection.
Finally, the third head -- an injection that distributes the drug, it releases it directly in the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't look like a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researchers of HIV in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying students -- not states, armed organizations like terrorists or insurgents or military.
I document what these groups do when they're not disability.
My goal is to understand the best of these generations of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition of violent participation to not violent.
I do field work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything conflict, because war has changed.
It used to be a speaker between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and actors not government.
For example, from the 1920s signed peace between 1975 and 2011, 1960 was signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these groups -- we should even involve them or defeat them in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they fight, how they do it, but no one is looking at what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and political polices are related.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less to defeat them, without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the Helicopting Health known for their violent cooling against Israel.
From his creation in the 1980s, Helico has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian Panderium, known by his suicide attacks against Israel, also administration of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multiplication.
They set up a complex machine of communication, radio stations, TV channels, websites of Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have IIA magazine, printed in English and published to recruit it.
armed groups also invest in a complex record of funds without sandwiches, but by restriction businesses, for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
armed groups also do something else, create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they manage hospitals, they put together a professional training program or microscope.
Hey offers all of these services and more.
armed groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state isn't being broken, security and protection.
The parking of the Taliban in a Afghanistan waste by the war or even the beginning of the IKEA promotion, can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means to fill a vacuum, a gap left by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006, Palestinian Hadles can't understand without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the armed groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrids.
They grow up because they fill gaps left by the government, and they emerge like armed and political groups, participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are, less we can take them as a opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like Helilon: How do we call a group like Healer?
They slept part of a territory, they manage all their functions -- they collect the trash of the failure system.
Is it a state? Is it a registered group?
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is IPMS?
The lines are driving.
We live in a world of states, of no state and hybrid nations and the more weak the states, like the Middle East, more intervene and fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in not military tools.
To fill that government gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and consider peace.
If we understand the armed groups, we will understand better what incentives to promote the transition of violence to not violence.
In this new distance between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security car, to fill that government gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are vehicles, but fear that I would openly accept the feminist label would be unfair for feminists.
I'm a feminist but pretty bad.
And therefore I get scared as a bad feminist one.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The Ball Feming," and then in the interviews, people started calling the Fellow Malaria.
So what started as a personal joke devoted to myself and a deliberate procedure, has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about feminist -- these furry women, angry with men and they hated sex -- as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people when I insisted it could be female.
It will be labeled as a feminist was an accusk, a taboo and dense word.
I was labeled as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which he asked too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that regime work, until he realizes that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are really broken, women are equal to men.
We deserve the same floor for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want, free or violence.
We have right to use easily and accessible the antibiotics and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need of legislative control or all evangelical doctors.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other identity.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender and religion and sexuality conditions, skills and much more.
We need to be aware of these differences and how they affect us, the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of incentives, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are evidence, but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad feminist of me.
I have another conference.
When I drive the work, I hear rap music painted to all volume.
Although the letter degraded to women, and I was profoundly offended -- the classic "Star Shake of the Yinls Yang Twin is incredible.
Make it reality with your left t-shirt.
Point, down, move until you get your cow."
Think about it.
Pure poetry, right?
I'm completely dead by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  all of the domestic tasks -- but also killing insects, the carbon card and the care of the complete machine.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see the Back and the romantic comedy comedy -- and I have fantastic fantasies of the stories that make it happen.
Some of my debates are more destroyed.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, it's your choice, and I'm not who to judge you.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I accept that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is confirmed so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they choose to choose women.
We solve this problem.
It took the conventional feminist that has ignored or handled historically the needs of color women, workers and human and transparent, for white women, heart and middle class and high.
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist for me.
It also happens this: As a feminist -- I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put feminists on a periphery.
We hope that they stick to perfection.
When they get off, we will take them with a lot of taste from the same person where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster -- I already consider me from that department before you try to put it there.
Too many women, particularly innovators and sector leaders, are afraid of being labeled as females.
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a feminist female for fear to what that tag means -- for fear not to be able to be able to be able to be able to get very realistic expectations.
Take Bean, or as I call it, the God.
Over the last few years it's a declared feminist food.
In the Museum Muslim Alexanders in 2014, at MIT, he played in front of the word "method of three meters tall.
It was a magnificent show, looking at this pop star openly embracing feminist and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
The time -- cultural critics started determination of endless debates if Bean was not precisely feminist.
They calculated their feminism instead of simply believing the word of an adult and mature woman.
We demand perfection of the feminist -- because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much, we need so much constantly.
We go much beyond the critical and constructive critic to design the feminist of any woman, to break it up until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminist, or rather, a more inclusive feminist is the point of particle.
But what happens next?
We're going to go from recognizing our experiences to figure out, go to action and be a little bit more valuable.
If I hear degraded music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more likely to provide an unlimited supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we expand change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why do you have your music that will be so paradise?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my niece, three and four years.
It's two magnificent girls, decided and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
Where they are appreciated by strong creatures that are.
I think of them, suddenly the best option is visualized as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sports -- it goes the Duranian game.
We can change the radio emissions when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema elsewhere when movies don't treat women more than as a decorative object.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers, like battlefield blocks.
In any case, men, especially white men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include enough numbers of women, both to participate like to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publication or your organization is more inclusive with a more broad range of people."
Those of us who are supported but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also refuse to be included until more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision-making points.
Because we are not beautiful best. Without these efforts, without embracing these positions -- our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and expect our decisions to get to the top, people in the power of direct and producers of cinema and music, CEO, the legislators that can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting and meaningful change.
We can also claim our feminism -- well, bad, or any note.
The last line of my book "Mark Feminison," says, "I would prefer to be a bad feminist to not be at all."
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I mean, especially because I love my voice and I was stolen and the feminist helped me take it back.
There was an incident.
I call it an incentive to address what happened.
A few kids draw me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
They stole my voice, and after all I didn't dare to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And with it I went back to writing.
It reminds me in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism -- I also discovered that if I was a bit brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to say we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the humble reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when more you need such a value.
Right after Christmas last year, 133 children in California, they had supply for having visited Disney or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then attracted the border with Canada, including more than 100 children in Come in County.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the children involved in the Disney outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly worse -- autism.
But a moment, wasn't the article that was unleashed about autism and decentralized vaccines, decompating and marked to be a fraud of the British Medical Decembing by the British Medical Deception?
Do you think most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a study?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world continue to get the vaccines to put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise estimates over time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and periods that I had heard about it create all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates followed only three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to shoot up.
Organizations of funding reports like Australians Spanish really refer to autism as an epidemic, as if it could be aware of another child in Disney.
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center of Disease Control in Atlanta, what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases as "putting diagnostic diagnostic "desires?
But that kind of language is not a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his two year-old son, the visual contact.
If diagnostic criteria had to expand why they were so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow and charged progress of science than the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how they discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with an infant psychiatrist -- Leo Kangito, from Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1994, Kanaha published an article that described 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds, including people around their own, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours holding hands on their faces, but they were prey of the panic of jellyfish as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of patients treated in their clinic, Kanaha speculated that autism is very rare.
In the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, to declare that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while collecting references of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not extraordinary, because Kanahula criteria for autism diagnosis were very responsible.
For example, destroyed to give that diagnosis to children with conversations, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
He once swore that he had turned nine out of 10 children sent by other doctors to his office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kangi was an intelligent man, but part of his theories were not accurate.
He classified autism as a form of child physicists caused by cold parents and destination.
These kids, he said, they've kept carefully in a refrigerator.
At the same time, though, Kanaha noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that are growing in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphony before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he was right to him, "Bear behind."
But Kana had a bad opinion of these skills, holding things like kids were simply reducing what they had heard of their parents, desperate to win their approval parents.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing Kanaha theory that autism was weird.
Long Winstan, cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of the mothers represented Kane was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm people and affectionate, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Susan.
Long and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Susan without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, London and his colleague, Judith Google decided to do something that should be 30 years before.
They took a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
They painted a London suburban called Carbotan to try to find autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the Kangi-production model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and more diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were faced in their fascination for the astronaut, in the dinosaurs or the generosity of the real.
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful squares and amazed, as Justine said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Konghamic model of Kanaha would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one have been caught from these children before?
But then Lord found a reference to an article published in German in 1944, the next year to the Kantie article -- and then I forgot down, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kangi knew about this piece of competition, but he avoided instrumentalist to mention it in his own work.
There was no even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of Lord spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Aspen, who led an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's to teach children with learning differences were even progressive for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and kids follow their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a political disability of life that required compassionate forms of support and spaces in the course of the entire life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and it became the development of the development of education methods that were particularly appropriate for them.
Finally, Aspen saw autism as a diverse continuum that would undermine an amazing variety of goods and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architects known in pop culture as the proper social scientist and the distracted professor.
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a fish of autism is essential.
Rwanda and Justine discovered that Kanaha was wrong in which autism was infectious, so the parents were the causes.
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of Philipperin to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that would reflect the diversity of what they called autism spectrum."
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into vegetable, replacing the limited model of Kanahina for a broad and even Asperger's model.
These changes didn't fall in screen short.
Essentially, when Lord and Judith worked between basis to reform these criteria -- people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before "Rad Man came out of "The Last Man in 1988, only a little circle, I was carrying on experts knew what the autism was, but after the innocent realization of Justice Man as Ram Babbage and the record of "Richard Man with four prizes of the Academy -- performance, psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials of using to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of "Richard Man changes and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism consciousness.
The number of diagnostics started to go up, just like London and Justine, in fact they hoped that it were, getting people to autism and their families finally got the support and the services that were designed.
So Andrew Washington came to blame vaccines for increasing diagnostics -- a simple, powerful history of creative history as bad as Kanahina theory that autism was infectious.
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one in 18 children in America are in the spectrum, the autism are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for the new medical advances -- when the term neuroscience to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand neuroscience is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows does not mean it's robot.
According to autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distributed, obviously, and it suffers from a deficit to the details.
No doubt, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching to Aspen, which believed that the surface for the most exciting aspects of autism are in understanding the teachers, employees with capacity, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named Brazil Zaches once said, "We need all the hands in cover to subject the boat of humanity.
As we navigate to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
