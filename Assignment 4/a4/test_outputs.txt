You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for a kid who read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothing.
Today I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is usually something that fell in somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> did.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, in the middle school, where I was the rare of the class.
When he was beaten up to bleeding every week in the boys' bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life saved by letting me go into the school room.
It would make it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1950s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we never get to know us.
You could get it to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to stick with it please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and we take care of her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew about how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that this is actually talking a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, and I was trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I <unk> them to me around the water -- almost 60 meters -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on the other snow year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers -- or they break the ice booms <unk>
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are refuse to hold up and hold up to the end, whereas others can't get them more and they were engaged in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated from isolated and alone, in large as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> is going to be a <unk> and I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg is released fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and will not be going to exist in that way again.
It's not death when they <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of frequent to get to see a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see on the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk>
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to take too much into the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joins the X X <unk> chromosome.
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity of the ground, I will meet two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are able to identify the anatomy -- the human bodies -- and <unk> how have the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that I work in my work is from an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with sex -- individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into male <unk> and conventional women.
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopt many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't fit in male and female forms.
For example, the case is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome. And it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we all have in <unk>
And then, in life -- the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there's high testosterone of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops in the course of a female course.
When you go back, the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast age, but it doesn't have the menstrual period when somebody realizes something is going on.
After doing tests realize that instead of having ovaries, and <unk> they actually have <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, we have the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most of the women as I -- I consider a <unk> woman who knows his structure, and I think to be a typical woman most of women as I are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed to the <unk> that the woman was born with <unk> that has the syndrome of <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way they can be everywhere.
Another example: makes a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life like a boy and he had just discovered that he had ovaries, and retirement.
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a hormone hormone environment.
As a result, their <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman on it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- that are <unk> twins, or <unk> or <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have have a better physical health of it.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it was <unk> various surgeries is that they are threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up with a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- being black wants to have African anatomy in historic terms.
A <unk> <unk> idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very careful ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very Romantic concept.
Imagine the amazing thing that you have children that are born like two people inside the same body.
The higher recent case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to ask, "What do you test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there isn't such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, the more we have to admit that these <unk> categories, we thought were very stable demographic categories that were <unk> directly with autonomous categories -- are much more <unk> than they were doing.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than what the terminology is about.
As we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you <unk> from the fact that they were in just a few <unk>
And as we moved out in science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> probably are too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles to the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very difficult discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to get me up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of them put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved still not to it.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extracting life organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma to really determine the death of someone. And this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm liberal, to make people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
We would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were <unk>
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find each so much watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with parents <unk>
The parents were <unk> -- the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did -- it was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers what our parents did, our <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
It was from the idea that the political power was going to be the right power of the blood passed from the grandfather and then the son, and so on.
The parents were rejected by the children, and they were rejected by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And in part of it they were doing it because they're part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time to do science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the story of the parents who are <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> out of the explanations -- and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid out the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people in color that <unk> the <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention to, I want to keep a few <unk> architecture in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be inspired by anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five people had to allow them to have sex and get married.
There are some <unk> demographic that for me make sense, and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term: was born the March March of 1980.
For the fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed all the rights to three months before Henry -- the right to the sex to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because he was born after.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being a man -- if I haven't told you, if it's <unk> in virtue of being a man is now <unk> from the <unk> of the God that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for his part, doesn't have the same rights to marriage as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is sort of a kind of an <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do it to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a weird position.
For example, Texas at a moment has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome. And to marry a woman you've got to have chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't do tests for the people.
But this is also very strange by given the story that I told you at the beginning of the syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for <unk> rights to people, because I know that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can take more intelligent <unk> intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships that people ever know.
So how do you put the subject of the contents of the <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to cause this current design stream to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they're willing to have a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple years ago that he had made birth <unk> twins to then pick them apart, and then they <unk> their <unk>
But when the phone asked her the point of the operation, it was a very broken operation -- she said that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum rather than <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are the people who are <unk> to change by the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think of what the democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say a little bit a little bit of a radical thing, and that is that I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> if there are people thinking of a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in research as well.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about the <unk> of <unk>
And I thought, "That's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I thought about the other thing that there is something of the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain, and the male that makes us more <unk> to the complex social and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very quickly to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible to have put more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection for <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when you give democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents in their residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count in a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily push it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But it just replaced by buildings.
Imagine half the ones that you wanted to live in apartment as they were in and the other half still <unk> to do it.
They could try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that around them have rules to avoid <unk> and <unk> of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, build a completely new apartment building, always and when the rules of that spread the construction instead of building it <unk>
So I proposed that governments will build new reform areas to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 miles would come up from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a Chinese crisis <unk>
In the next regular election, regular elections, <unk> <unk> had been launched, with a platform where they promised reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked her to <unk> his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence for users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the other residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of technologies like <unk> rules and usually are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed you to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion at some point, when there was a pause, and he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain a <unk> that we <unk> the rules that are attached to and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is forward.
And he asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, that I was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be able to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the north.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the government leaders would need help from <unk> countries, could benefit from the countries that help them establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all be able to rely on the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be <unk> by a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow for these special inclusive regions.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis in Congress to this constitutional law was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in the society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
And on February 17, they spent again in another voting or <unk>
Immediately after the voting in the 21st of February, a delegation of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that's being built in North Korea, it's bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years to get the <unk>
The other country in the construction of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would enable the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the <unk> <unk> for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> area and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to get a job job, sometimes they have to earn money for so only eating or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen -- in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, I was asked to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I am going to make a public confession -- and that is, I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photographing and publish in my blog <unk> and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is in a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The <unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are generally passionate about my money going to a good <unk> and my way is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I want <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of inner clothes and nothing else.
I built inside for a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walks for TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the set for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger tiger,
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the whole, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be wrong with <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red pants when you're wearing it.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not only just <unk> you get stuck.
<unk> <unk> of the boy that you take in.
Sometimes people tell me that I want to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth about six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a cool way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it again and again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, I'm going to give up everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy suit and colorful and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I'm over.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you were to take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical.
This would be a completely intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a big <unk> <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just just like most other quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed with the age of the years is the one that says one thing can be just in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and I didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that parking bar that was taught a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with <unk> <unk> play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point was the physics of the number of years, you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not very good for my intuition, and maybe it's because I didn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it also doesn't get me well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles are still the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't go on the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why I didn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we make a big approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal -- with a form of springboard and which is <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip again, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming basis that's found underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up with doing those things, because I don't want to do it, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The coworkers of voyage of inanimate objects are not only people, but it's also the light that <unk> and the wind going on on their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal piece according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights out, then we put a <unk> and pulled all the air out, and then they break it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when it's only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as it wants.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way they <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that I don't mean at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a thing is <unk> and they don't fit at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that metal piece are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on the scale between one atom and that little metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part that we talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do your consciousness act if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we cut it, and we turned the lights up and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator actually are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about that quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things you do, literally define you who you are, and that's the profound queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories and stories -- it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explains just on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and went to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, try to do the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show you a couple of interesting things that we have done from his launch.
So, let's say, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorites, <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click click on the inside.
They are inside, which wants to go at the end of the hall,
keep going forward. What is it <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the word <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 billion <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to have a <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And so I did a little bit of a little bit of a little bit with some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a stick with a stick on Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get to even deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you'll see what there are.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to look at the <unk>
And if you want to see how you're supposed to do this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things more here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create its own museum -- create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walk -- I've created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send you to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all the incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, it even came out of the museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think that it's a <unk> a square inch.
In our lab we call this responsive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm an Italian, all kids in Italy growing up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in <unk> careers -- one in the last two decades.
Already some time, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, take a budget and take it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you got to make the career.
This is what in engineering -- in engineering, <unk> system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics and electronics.
They're becoming an outdoor computers.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumer consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms to become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end I took the hammer and he threw it into the Moses -- -- -- -- -- -- you can actually see a little <unk> a <unk> <unk> and said, <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just some <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer summer, in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Perhaps some of all, played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by watching activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
In the early afternoon, there are people over here and doing so-called <unk>
It starts silent.
<unk> from France.
You know, people do a quick call on the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First of the time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night they were all at <unk> at the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world drops it.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume things.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how is it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in their change by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are in all of a <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a label on the garbage and then we start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are complicated things that are complicated and lots of transportation.
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't know, is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still goes on there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My fellow from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we've talked about at first, which is actually driving over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water use in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT in a workshop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water with water pixels with water.
If you get the pixels to be able to write on them, I'll show patterns, images, <unk>
And by <unk> the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to Mayor <unk>
He liked it very much.
And we put a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it the <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you're going to come up with it opens so you can actually happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower the roof.
Or you can close the building, and all the architecture is lost, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there and said, "Get the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture is gone.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> what happens inside.
And here I am myself trying to don't get the sensors that open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun to me.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let you happen, but a building that kept doing <unk> and water holes, and you had to jump into not getting wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel changes that it changes color as a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with other in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud, as we could form this cloud, as we could form this cloud, to form.
This is a flexible display like this with a normal display in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of hidden pixels to the one that you can get close to it, and you can see from very diverse perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of mine from today, the star of the New York City <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> to capture his 3D movements and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a motion capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go along the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and motion, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry to the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine that we could involve people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> nursery like farming <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could all be able to make it a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've got everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is going to be able to move away from the digital world, of the self-organizing power, of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow may be to address the challenges of today, think about climate change or CO2 emissions how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move around, you can get different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the Olympic Olympics, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up as a new top of London.
You can go in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could improve it by a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be a better way, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
What about good health?
Or maybe those people who wanted to be more creative.
What else is it that they <unk>
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> was probably supposed to be a lot of creative people.
That's really good.
How many would you want memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference but I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology has felt except for the light of the <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or of the future?
refers to the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is of course, the more interest we care.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
We have been maybe 20 or 25 species of hominids.
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here for a few <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the most basic machine machinery is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> of which it comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the gut more bacteria than the cells that have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, do you think -- when Antonio <unk> would take you from <unk> you think of <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm <unk> <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort in your part.
It's really like a fast pathway to the bacteria with the occasional evil of some rush to <unk>
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest their <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what will we give ourselves the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a small note.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was doing <unk> at college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental about the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when the organisms show up, things start to change.
It goes into the National reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body is in evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death -- death -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with every year I was happening, every single time had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their <unk>
And one night somebody hits your hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of him, he finds a little slight dancer <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"I say, George, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to make us healthy.
I wanted to regain health in disease.
I wanted them to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going through the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I'm kind of like rockets to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of us -- the feeling that voiced Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution did not necessarily benefit the longevity.
Not necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the most smart.
Evolution benefits the most adapted creatures to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the ocean bacteria, that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish wrapped up the vacuum -- yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward, at the phase.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and escape from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that they were attached to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, it <unk> <unk> and we become so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to make that evolution.
A second possibility is that the evolution of the traditional kind of natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when it sort of <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, a possibility, and intriguing education, intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first as we first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and a family level.
Think about if it could be possible to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body making genetic adjustments to heal or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and she sued 13.
<unk> billion dollars.
By the next year, it's finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near the age of 20,000 or about a week.
Not a lot of not a lot to do the human genome by <unk> and being more and more in the reach of all.
You come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against flu <unk> in cells from a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or to change the newborn egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't we have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you were able to do it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that lets us run faster and more <unk>
Why not live more time?
And this is going to be an assistant.
And when we are in conditions that are going to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices for a better successful, more successful society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want to do for some of us, but not for anybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest worst of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom that we need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what might make these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably <unk> some <unk>
The pilot had already taken the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot pilot the plane with the Hudson River.
Often that is not the road.
The motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words I've heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't know, all the fences that I wanted to accumulate all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
And as I thought about that later, I got a phrase, which is, <unk> wine wines and <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that urgency, it really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, it also gives rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I think of things that didn't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk>
And the third thing I learned -- and this is what your mental clock is going on, <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
Am I saying, "Please be <unk>
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die not fear.
It's almost like we have been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love it; I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
And at that point, I understood these two points that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For most of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was gave a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and will live in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you going to do, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would they change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel like <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the start of ALS.
Today, <unk> has total paralysis,
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design business and animation so that obviously, graffiti is something intricate we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second one is not that you have seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and have a very good insurance can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they're doing <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check and rather than that signed a check I had no idea of how I was going to <unk>
I teamed up with her brother and his father right there at that particular -- "OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't be able to get it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move the things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine to <unk> it could take a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world by all the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and when they were born, they would have taken out the frames of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went down to the shipping road, my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They're a pair of <unk> <unk> that we bought in the <unk> walk of <unk> Beach, some wire wire and <unk> and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it into a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- -- and it builds up, we published it yourself, we published the software <unk> the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say <unk>
There is no hospital that I can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis has access to draw and communicate using only his eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of planning, a whole day of all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of life, and it's looking through through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he came back in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was, we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti too.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what said, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and they would get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and <unk>
We've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 major inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up at the end of the <unk> is that in April of this year at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: If you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it wrong with anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with recognition technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we will find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, you get it, you know?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years to do in situations very difficult and at the same time an dangerous one.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
He in <unk> and dangerous <unk>
And I spent 30 days eating this -- just fun at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in great part of my career I've been involved in situations in such awful situations with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that we would expect to look at social issues, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that would look cool and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago, I pulled out a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and as content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridicule to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title of progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't have told for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in terrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could have gotten me wrong, for something as difficult as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that deals with product <unk> marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with products, and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, it has a little bit of brand, all the time; all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title -- the brand is.
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> when we filmed them forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what?
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was only <unk> It was more by <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X in the title, but we're going to make sure by giving all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you have a shoe -- and you become the most brilliant shoe that you've got <unk>
The most cool car that you've ever been driving in "The largest <unk> you ever had, the best drink you ever had, the best drink that you've got from "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Making the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the filmed is the transparency.
You'll see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot -- beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- it's the most respect for the audience.
And yet, I don't know how <unk> it is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> How much money does you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for them, but that certainly is going to be worth convince a couple of big parts.
<unk> knows, maybe for the moment that the film comes to us to look at it as a lot of <unk> idiots.
MS: What do you think it's going to be the response?
So Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: It means you're not really optimistic.
So, I <unk>
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. So that's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where it is to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the media, is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a mistake of <unk> and that error was this.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you --  -- like that <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
They would take a <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> history.
We want it to take a story -- but we want <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as he used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
There's your story, and it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that was just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the proxy and go to the business myself.
So what I started to see from suddenly -- and I started to tell you, is that when you start talking to companies -- the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big, big, big, big, big ones, and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies -- giant Hollywood say that the reason their movies are so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm coming out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say are really cool to this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And then you offer one of these <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as well as to <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> We are a small brand.
<unk> to the sort of smaller movies that we <unk> are a little bit more like a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people are the reason why this is interested.
MS: How words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category at positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep them cool more time? And more importantly, three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about the ancient kind of common?
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing "Sex and the very <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a brand <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because I <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Nation <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often lie on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we think about the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case where they come from, and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: So what's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next is this was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your form of be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what is it about?
What's the <unk> What phase you are here now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more about you, who is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
It doesn't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what you're going to get out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but it <unk> in your personality of <unk> the Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some businesses are only going to be involved in one of your strong dots or the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend -- and it's nature's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear of those items, and you actually get to accommodate and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come up and come up and come up and come up with a pretty powerful thing.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to take your identity <unk> your brand, what would it be?
You're a <unk> "You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool like the contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold or bold as a <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic
Or are you more good than <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You are a traditional established, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacredness, <unk> or wise ones, like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain as much for commercial marketing as a movie for film.
We went to San Paulo where they were forbidden by the outdoor <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no wall, no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the schools in the U.S. problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the most answer or the ones that I've had more successful ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you gone? Did you succeed?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not really wrong because most of the agencies that we talk about is telling their customers not to be part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you pull out the people that are pushing them to the failure.
I think that when you train your employees in loss -- at risk I'm preparing their company for being <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. Let's have the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the peril.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to go along a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- <unk> has been presented by my good friends from <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name on <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I was looking at the name of the transparency, that exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check for the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my care for TED <unk>
The idea behind the Gordian worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest active to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are in real time systems.
If we managed to engage these systems that control the speeds and <unk> can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus Windows on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box -- <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we began to investigate <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
And it seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes, these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where you put our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they were very strange things.
<unk> were <unk> like a laboratory rat where he didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is effectively working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that was called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant from the United States or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we would have a target soon.
So we pulled out and opened up the attack, and we found out that I was <unk> in two square bombs a small and a big one.
We also found that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all of the points to attack.
They probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to engage with the real world, with potential targets of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
You don't find several thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant from <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
And I called them and I ended up in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that part of a mobile phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make it explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get it.
I started researching scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> what is called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 different parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had with each other.
It wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been due to several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to start again.
Yet, we found out that both digital digital <unk> would say to one single goal, but from different perspectives.
So the little kid is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six yards and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really had to get stuck.
That's the gray box, and the top of you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the values of input from the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the <unk> sensors and provides <unk> which is still running during the attack, with <unk> <unk>
And believe it or not, these <unk> data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security chamber.
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, on a energy plant, when the large steam turbine is going on speed, you have to open out of escape escape in a <unk>
And obviously this can't make it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And no <unk> or the security system would be <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think of this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> of <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden on a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology.
It was possible as possible.
And if you do that, that with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we start to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My mind is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower,
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give <unk> skills or another that makes users of chairs and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different than something that goes in in the morning, gives you a great force, which is in addition to its speed, and help, for example, managing balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it to the universe and with other Islamic objects.
This is not an <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on is what we're working on by talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a 45 pounds, and you get it down to get it more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions in the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can <unk> 90 pounds of land for many hours.
Its flexible design allows you to get into <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
So it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of chairs of the wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation of this.
We talk about something that happens to often often people very young, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their lives -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population of the aging population, so quickly.
Their only option, many times -- a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't be able to go back for 19 years now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
You have some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that they send signals to the board computer here on the back.
There are some batteries that give power to the engines on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move into this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing through the air on the bottom <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a whole feeling and all of the <unk> movement to the bottom.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never again.
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last glimpse of the hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down rocks and even ride a bicycle <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the users of chairs and all of them all all of the users.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest life.
That means that we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by the large, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the deep forest deep and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict, which has been given for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation is that you can't fill up with no stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and, honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes -- the love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solving social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, I love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of values, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the roots of the roots themselves and the dance and the human culture.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> has <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as much as human as humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk>
I think that as it is, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world to more and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's take our ability of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate to play, they can be the most <unk>
And so, fellow people primates, we accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together while they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of a captain in a fire department to volunteers.
And in our city, where the volunteers are <unk> a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a career on the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and find out what our jobs were.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and she was in her home and she was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- he came to the captain first to the captain and asked him to go into and <unk> the dog owner.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building to save a live <unk> just because I won by five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and you bring this woman a couple shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> firemen at the end of the hallway that they had ended up on the middle of the fire and entered the main room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house with the owner of home where, as he was expected, his trove was much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from <unk> <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at was about what else was somebody had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling at Robin <unk> as in my calling to my <unk> <unk> I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> acts and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they are in the same room remarkable success -- I'd like to remind you to remind you this: I don't know.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, it will be now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a park in the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's lives, but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks of concrete blocks in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement from a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the brick bricks.
It's been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 billion of them on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the particular block block in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> brick and piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much bigger and more complex, a brick at the same time.
But there's a difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't think about it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best of everything is that they connect through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
<unk> have a color code.
The watch, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just put together a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with one green one is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, it's here, and now we have a light <unk>
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to connect and connect and <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or slower, just moving this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to become <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given to children to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a night light works, or why the <unk> door is being open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  ago, a few weeks ago we took <unk> to the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island who have no experience to engineering, just wood and paper and paper and said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of <unk> that is afraid of darkness.
For these no engineers, it became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us.
And so, <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is trying to get involved with the environment focusing on the focusing on.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I know that time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work on government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like about <unk> <unk>
We had some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending the Third World to the Third World We send them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is someone else <unk> when it gets caught up in the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help from this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- very much last year.
They realized that the city has never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else that citizens are born with shovels the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You follow <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe the smallest of the 21 applications will be the last year.
But it does something that no other technology in the U.S. government.
And it spreads in viral.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City, to looking at this app realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work on these <unk> of tsunami, but people are drinking the batteries.
That's why the citizens <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to get people to <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use using it.
And this has been spread out of <unk> in organic and natural.
If you know a little government technology, you will know this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power court power that until the time has 10 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is program on a couple of days and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of stop shooting at the institution of government.
It suggests to the government better ways to work, not as well in private businesses, as many people think that it should be.
It's also not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way we look at the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to put together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country who contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
You haven't given the government.
They feel a lot of frustration before that, but they don't know about it.
And these people know something we have lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave aside the feelings about politics, row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we are putting in, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because we were alone not <unk>
Now, many people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you to get it, because things are changing.
The politics didn't know the government so.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> how to think about it will affect how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the phone fund center and information center.
It's the place that it serves calls if you mark on the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put some tough music in and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a website and mobile and called <unk> <unk>
They didn't get that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually happened in fact, this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, and I found the bucket behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet nights, <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of the government in the government to volunteer voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technology of technological platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to lie and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And I could try to connect with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another neighbor help the communities.
If we call control control -- that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but they think you're the gate of the other.
That our input to the government system is a vote.
How many times have you chosen a <unk> leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is taking our values and their own needs, but then we can't see changes.
That's because the government is because the government is a huge ocean, and the politics is the shallow superficial layer.
This is why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that holds us that it is that we funded as something that is operating on our own, that other thing, and consequently, we are losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy out of it.
Because it's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed set of citizens who have written pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> from <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's mutual activism.
And for those of us who have <unk> us to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to look at the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we will be able to go without the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the government rethinking so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act on, you just have to articulate the systems of the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I have been a bigger generation than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to speak, everybody will talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at all at the same time and do it.
So when the government problem face doesn't matter so much to do hear their voices.
They're using their hands.
They bring the work to program applications that make a better work for the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a fire hydrant, taking off a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until not <unk> the citizen <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here when it comes to the important things we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and on death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is important.
Here we saw fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born over the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little and I looked at her, she was approaching me and I gave myself a good story.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then get stuck.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he was approaching me, and I said, "You know, you still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying it no, I got back again and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at him and she was like, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up across the room, I took my hand out of my hand, and he said, "Come on to me, <unk> <unk> We go to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I never forget.
It took me out and said, "You know, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I said, "Now I said, <unk>
And then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I never forget.
And then he said, "There I want you to take me up, three things ...
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I read it.
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you'll always be doing the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I thought, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never really <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I read it.
I grew up in the field, in South Idaho, I have a brother a year older and a younger sister.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took us my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got doing the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and I was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister has a <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother stares at me.
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
And I went down the gaze and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells everybody the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this to be spread away.
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I say that the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others who don't really see any sense.
We can't get to do things that they don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of alcohol.
And these were the things that we think about it, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest <unk> rate of the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much socially despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or for parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all young people in the color are in jail or for parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that frames the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not a problem.
We're <unk>
It's really interesting.
We're looking at our work in the work some good developments as well.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you'll kill you, for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before it was before it was the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no possibility to go out again.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They have people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about the way we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine people, <unk> has identified one which is innocent and released from the death row.
One of a mistake, you know, an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation you wouldn't allow it to ever fly airplanes if every single nine that would come in, you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in history <unk> I talk about slavery at the time.
I talk about terrorism, the time they started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The terror of terror was what defined its lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you're talking about, <unk> Stevenson, you're talking about <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, <unk> we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades and race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
And all of the time we will go to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage ourselves with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't overcome race segregation without the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't been done.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's OK to listen to what you would expect.
<unk> "We have no death row in Germany.
<unk> we will never be here."
The room was silence and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us intentional and <unk> we could put in the <unk>
So let's look at this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We could not get it.
It was irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things are <unk>
We love innovation.
We love technology <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate both of them.
We talked about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
And thinking about it it is, in a way, something that's inside of our being.
We really have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so deeply committed to intellectual,
With innovation, development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas too, by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, will a will be in places of despair and be <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we do these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a very young, young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to go, <unk> comes the lady. <unk> we're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. Be lady.
So she would say, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
And so I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And in one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks led to me and said, "Now, you know, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving myself my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom with the kids.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end up with <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and I gave it all my best speech and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got his finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humankind depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, certainly, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very exhilarating <unk> we don't judge our technology by our designs, and our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich powerful and <unk> but the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, you all know.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond me in a major way.
I've been representing these kids who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge can turn someone into what is not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night he was awake at the wake of God, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not from, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a small poor, white.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> <unk> is treated as a privileged white <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In <unk> I had been there to have been <unk> behavior, in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country is not ethical but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up to think that <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
So for my horror, not only had <unk> it had sent the court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten that.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down the car. He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man -- he was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's you. I said yes.
And so I got up, and I got stuck.
And I was standing on the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That gets deeply involved with my interior, with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I walked into the audiences.
When I got in, the judge saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> I said. And we started now."
People started getting there. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They came the policemen by the <unk> the prosecutors the <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- and I just got out of races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look through the window and you'll hear all that <unk>
You walk around here and for there.
Finally, this old black, a face of worry, entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would take a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black guy stood up, and he looked at me and she looked at me and said, "Let's get this room of audiences to tell this young man to keep his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We can't truly be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to the other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity have to refer to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in this community, to help in your terms, to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are various opportunities close by.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will become an effort to make the funds that you spend today in policy policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of the rapes don't get at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to come up with the law of security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it is said it has to do with the greatest <unk> rate.
What would you say to those who think that is?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war war.
That's why this is a dramatic increase in the population of the population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to lead people to chain to steal a bicycle by stealing a bicycle by small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've excited to be excited about today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats by death Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months of <unk> could be from the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to it.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survival, the first stop at all that data is an ancient clip of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, the <unk> detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So the story of the stories would look at the negative.
That old saying from the <unk> "If there is blood blood, it is very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news -- the seven days a week, 24 hours a day, is no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world goes wrong at worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, climate change, the <unk> of species -- the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings, we are very good at taking the problems and the long time, just with them.
Let's look at what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average per capita income over inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food -- electricity and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles segments that global literacy happened 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to follow higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, no <unk> mobile phone, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would have dreamed of such a <unk>
So a lot of this is technology and, lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the technology of information jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that has in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times cheaper than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad days, in war and peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It is an open computers we used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it's curve up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
So the computer in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, the 3D printing and the ability to democratize and personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, <unk> fuels the vaccines and food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline as I could.
And I loved this one: <unk> <unk> for that?
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available intelligence for all of your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can be <unk> the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, there would be absurd.
Today we can point out a bunch of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> is about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking it out of that that is <unk> and making it up.
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three in the middle of the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
The peacekeepers ate with covered with a covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum.
You see, the aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet, was about more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum.
You see, although the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal thing.
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with the <unk> and he made the aluminum so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
It will take this analogy into the future.
Let's think about energy waste.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about starved but from <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> per rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States, electric electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we have plenty of water.
Let's now talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager patterns to the Earth, in 1990, then it went to <unk>
It was a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, <unk> is seawater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small fridge size.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water by the day of any <unk> saltwater, saltwater, contaminated water, by less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just assumed that it will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola will implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation by this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile.
Oh my God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile phones in the middle of Kenya who President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that the Clinton President 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens of thousands of dollars -- and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> images, or libraries of books and music, technology and diagnostic technology now <unk> and lose market value with mobile.
Maybe the best thing comes when you come up with the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the <unk> X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device that you talk, and because it has <unk> you can <unk> you can get blood out of your finger.
To win it has to do better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> burden is from 25 percent of health workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that won't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, to prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just got the brand of seven billion dollars.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world education and health care world.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we will go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before they add to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you do? What would you say?
And instead of a economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of the story.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And health care from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- and because of using color impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you provide three billion members of humanity, healthy <unk> and <unk>
How about some voices never before we had before.
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and being able to act for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if you are contributions we can't <unk>
Something that I learned with the X X is that small teams guided by his passion with a goal of course, can do things -- things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a show that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and find out how the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and <unk>
It's really important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this university professors, with each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people got joined and began to <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three three billion other minds that we are focused on to work on the solution of the great challenges and to do what we should do.
We have in front of a few remarkable decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of departure.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I would give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they thought I was <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually pick up fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special to do.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets they still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition at the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from a few <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 meters, the <unk> of black beard, it.
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and was going on for a good moment, so I became more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went down to five centimeters tall.
So let's take a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
They were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1950s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly, he was called <unk> 4.
I went out fishing on it, and we did studies in the south of the Sea of China <unk> and, above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of the tiny ones about <unk> remains that are fish of coral reef, right?
In short, the sea bottom came on the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start fishing fishing.
The bottom bottom of being a robust coral fund in this case, will be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> They were dead, because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I wasn't still <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never had fish.
But it's not <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't.
We had the starting point to begin to the start, new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, so many of the <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images that have received the beginning of their conscious life as normal and how they extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the amount of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep some remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before it <unk> it's unusual.
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals at all.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because they <unk>
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not in the way they would expect that they have the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of us present, like the captain of a captain and a lot of fish looked at this area in this area you can't use it, or usually they don't use the fishing scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
There is a huge paper that can be turned to a protected <unk>
Because with marine protected areas we actually visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has been running and it's incredibly low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision to <unk> which allows them to delete their point of departure.
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think there are arts and film maybe can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the <unk> bay of 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager to look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made in the virus and what the importance has to do.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, they come to us in a part of our world culture.
Anybody who can do very famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of viral takes lots of visits and it makes a variety of cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot out of his home in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of the popularity of the last summer.
<unk> was not saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Mountain Mountain <unk>
We had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this minute?
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present to us and interesting things and <unk> them to a larger public.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday on his Friday.   So you have to start on the end of a week, the weekend.        <unk> on a Friday.  KA: You won't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Rebecca <unk> Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
And just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nowhere.
So what happened day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> it's a Friday.
But what happened this day on Friday in <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in doing a joke about video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of creators embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great internal joke, then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century entertainment entertainment difference is our way to be part of the phenomenon of <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with an <unk> music.
That's what that's it.
This year, they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that is rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that piqued between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did one version of the ancient one.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, a whole community came out of a remix, that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca or Rebecca <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written by this <unk>
In a world where two days of video goes up two days of video per minute, just that that really unique and unexpected can be <unk> how these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a kind that protest against <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get interested in much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not circular for the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you properly properly through the <unk>
KA: Because of the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> made five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all new things that we do differently?
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of participation, creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are features of a new type of culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
We are now a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media -- but it is <unk> the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been fully in vain.
And the words for so long friends, <unk>
It is <unk> in silence.
He died in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I was going to do it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of <unk> resulting into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task for her family and new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And then from a <unk> <unk> which challenges the fiction, a boat.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear were the disorders, rape and death.
Like most of the adults my mother was wearing a <unk> <unk>
If we were going to ask you first, I would take my sister and I, and then my grandmother.
My first memories are of that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast vast and gap.
I don't remember hackers who came a number of times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start to start for six hours.
But I can remember the lights from the oil platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I tried to, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in the long three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is made of immigrant <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of class, whose existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> fragments of English -- between people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars there were <unk> and they established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, they would not matter what it was supposed to be <unk> that generally was <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs in school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> over the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were focusing on our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to help me.
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened up another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition angry and <unk> and boys were caught between two worlds.
It took subsidies and <unk>
and they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
And in one, it was the classic <unk> student with what <unk> from myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, involuntary <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But a lot of people received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer elected the young Australian man from the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges didn't exist.
So <unk> <unk> anonymously from <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that had never heard of, and in homes whose existence would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ends up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> over the day of each one and running <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we climb into the ship.
The "no" "no" had ever been an option.
<unk> he said, "What are you not going to be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And the more that the more I was talking about, the more I was talking about was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the trails of life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my job, I realized I could not stay in a career of <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a little come again in the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world would be, but not in the way we fear the world.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a mix of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
It took a small group of people to the whom the motto cannot <unk> was a more challenging challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They go down to the entrance to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before you end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered to.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised alone.
17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't be done being wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room, when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell them stories and made sure that we were still with it.
The night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have it.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have <unk>
The defeat would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to know?
However, I'm afraid to the privilege of the easy, right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave brave in each wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantees anything?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them safe to do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and run the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was born, the great prince warrior <unk> I was <unk> I would pull out a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The bottom line was that the machinery had replaced with magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not to kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pocket silver <unk>
And this piece over 50 years was for me the most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the sense that the mobile wristwatches.
Our inspiration.
That's why I <unk> I came up with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than kill her.
I read books since 16 years old.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device that was able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
We put the text with the image, animation and touch.
The storytelling becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that serve us?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  It says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character in the book.
And in a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and dragons, but that magic of childhood childhood, those ideas that we children's children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always <unk>
So, over here, we have to get the iPad to release the fireflies.
And it really light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy was going into a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of a fantasy there has always been maps but these are static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of book it is also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and moist book.
So we're bringing them back into a child history <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where we have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and they collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the children don't do it.
So in order to recover this ritual of childhood we have to go out and in one chapter, it took a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can then put on the Web.
A little boy in London puts a photo of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have a interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video on and by actually augmented reality, you see a bunch of cartoons that appear about the interior plants from the house.
And at a moment, the screen is full of leaves out.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature is attached to technology and magic and technology and technology come close to each other.
<unk> energy energy.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and child love that we feel through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University University was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What's <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all of us, but most of the <unk> projects they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's something very simple.
It has a doorknob on and <unk>
Every morning I get stuck.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my data to Google <unk>
And my medical doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time when it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my <unk> Wi-Fi and before I got up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity of their own health control.
From the next week it will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people will come from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they turn to recover the control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention <unk> the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video video.
We all have checks at <unk>
Maybe even we have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where neurons are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to <unk> you see a <unk> please be <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in the <unk> office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 people were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> they can use your iPhone, and at the next few weeks to use his cell cellphone to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to look at the global level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find, working as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which shows is still in their place.
Please take us in this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, these are pictures that they can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my previous passion for drawing but it was a little bit different because using the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera with a camera that is <unk> the <unk>
For me, photography had more than to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start with the press <unk>
<unk> like this is a <unk> construction in a very tight road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And yet, in spite of it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like dark and colorful ones, but with the common aim of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to seem to have been captured in some way like photography.
You know, you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it real?
Are the details or the <unk>
<unk> the light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfect objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way they can create something that still looks like it was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even understand, the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs is very important to <unk> because otherwise something looks bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will follow for realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are combined to have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make us impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect deal.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And in the personal thing I think it's easier to create a place that you find out because you don't need to put the ideas that has on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made red the house on the top of the island for it to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome I think we need planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take pictures of the photos, the result can be very beautiful and at the same time as well.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing a slide of technology, very boring.
Please do if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I made from a folder mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of Diet microprocessors versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this is a lot of others that we tend to see, is a straight line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves that is new.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
It <unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we make technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years or a <unk> and this would be any of the technology that I would like to tell you, the diagram would look something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you were <unk> for example, another technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you have a change <unk>
If the technology of the transportation technology <unk> as fast as the <unk> we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of economic growth, which every few years will advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves that we see not forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
<unk> one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve, and I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way you <unk>
How new is the world going.
The transition seems very, very confused if we're embedded in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
That a transformation, can you feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that might be that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about two and a half billion years when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with many chemicals going around it.
So if we look at the way those chemicals organize these chemicals we have a sense of how things came in.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at the time, there was a few oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical recipes in their inside.
Some of those drops of oil drops a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and so the droplets grew up grew up grew up of the <unk>
And they started split.
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them had a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> it will be <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that we have.
That's why each <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that somehow drops to being better at the time of bringing chemicals together, <unk> more, <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, a very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these drops <unk> learned the trick of the <unk>
In some way we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we were able to <unk> in this <unk> evolution of writing that allowed them to record what they were to be in order to be able to be able to be able to save them.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved half two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide at the TED security.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card I have a lot to all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would have taken it through the room.
What was the next here?
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily be happy another billion years.
But then there was another great step in which things were going to be very different from which things were very different and was that these cells started trading and communicate information into the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, it evolved the resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are lots of <unk> <unk> because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
From that <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community together on a supply chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities -- communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or your muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And building very special structures that they weren't doing more than process information in community.
These are the neural structures.
neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave us an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not by the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because he knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these kinds of processing processing structures that we have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the engineered nervous system built those incredibly accelerated information structures the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the more <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea in your head.
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated we made it into sound, in sound, and produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, in fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we go through periods of periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
<unk> computer <unk> the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where that produced certain evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages the nervous system and the brain took a few hundred million years.
And so many years, they took less than a million years.
And the planets, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this mountain explosion.
We see the process <unk>
But I make the life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the developments in recent events.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to do for me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with it that does something that before you couldn't do, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it's used methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have computers, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions.
You could run these random instructions at random, running all of those programs, and to take those more people who are <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order a simple example to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, they would take numbers, so none of them succeeded.
But one, luckily, it could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they would get the <unk>
Let's take those and get them to the rest.
And now we <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, which <unk> <unk> and that children will support the properties of both of them.
So we got a new generation of programs that were born from <unk> programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
And we would get some mutations in it.
He's trying to try and try and try and get another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are going to be able to make numbers for absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to figure out how they work.
These are dark programs.
But do the <unk>
In fact, I have the security of the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that could do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to provide a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make design processes very well.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so they could run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they were <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
Are we <unk>
And we're at a moment analog to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our thinking that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes to lunch and I think we're going to stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've spent enough time to let myself give part of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting out <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope that many of you have heard it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> which has 300.
That means <unk> bat <unk> three times.
That means to launch the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and that anyone who is about <unk> the first base, it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is someone that <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the <unk> League player in serving more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more awkward, or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have a <unk> and you come to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now assume that you live in a remote place, and you want two clogged arteries -- <unk> and your family physician takes it to a cardiologist whose record of <unk> is <unk>
But do you know something?
She's getting a very much better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask them.
What do you think should be the average of a heart surgeon, or a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I was included by being perfect.
What ever, would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I had when I was in medical school.
I was a devout student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood tests.
All right.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the University of nurses at the General Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis, and you get frequent <unk> and <unk>
And I even knew the diagnostic diagnosis on how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And meanwhile, more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the medical school with the impression that if you were <unk> everything, then it would know everything, or the most possible thing to do, because this is how I get away from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the emergency service to the emergency service where I worked on.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when the emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist I had to go to that patient.
And it will report to the boss of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would tell him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I really made two more mistakes in fact.
He sent her home without talking to the boss of residents.
I didn't put up the phone and I did what I should have done, which was call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident a constant resident to be a constant.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to his house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my interior that said, <unk> isn't a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse who <unk> Mrs. <unk> <unk> who is okay if you go to the <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with complete <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high and the ambulance next to the walls brought her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, of it.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I was going to be able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. So I did something I don't do normally, at the time.
I went through the emergency service of the way home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> of the lunch lady before, but another one. I was told three words, those three words that most doctors have been <unk>
Other specialists fear fear that too, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients.
The three words are: Remember you?
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the tall, she had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the E.R. brought the emergency room with a blood pressure, 50 percent of <unk> which means a shock of severe <unk>
I just just breathe and he was blue.
The emergency staff took all their resources.
They gave medication medication to raise the blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days later, it was obvious that I never got to.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> what was happening.
And by the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of the they die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks later, I was struck by it and I experienced for the first time <unk> that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, and without feeling that healthy shame because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The shame I'm talking about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the things out, and I made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send him home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little at a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in a <unk> day, he opened up the sky, and finally the sun came out and wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if you were making the efforts to be perfect for not to make more errors, I would stop those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an assistant, in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a bit <unk>
He got out of penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he ran the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And I gave the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient he saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, it's not the throat, but it's the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics per <unk> and they recovered at the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were getting to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
So we had an X-ray of the kidneys -- but it turned out a colleague who was checking into the patient perceived to some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was very much diarrhea.
And I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to get it.
And I looked at it and when I noticed some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, It was called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was telling you, I was shocked.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful things have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: if I can't tell you about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after not, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- you know, I would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that you can't sleep, and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an antibody reaction, as antibodies start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we care about medicine to people who make mistakes, we're going to get a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal personal study of bad health and medical failures to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for Toronto <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every single day, where one in 10 drugs will invest in the hospital are wrong, or the <unk> is not correct. In a system that <unk> infections are increasingly more and more <unk> and <unk>
In this country, they die in this country, 24,000 medical failures <unk>
The U.S. Institute of Medicine established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not managing the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge goes down every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that can make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take on the same patient with an chest pain in his chest, and with breath of alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we get off, and we eliminate all the professionals who are likely to error, well, no one.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- it's a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to all, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students got <unk> and he will go down and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They opened their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people who don't have the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and in a loving way, and they all <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes once in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a physician <unk>
I am human, making mistakes.
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices who say to pick an American American, are about 70 to day.
Not a lot ago, in a week in a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks over these executives and the time they were going to be able to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your elections.
You know how many belong to the age of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you grade the way that we manage those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to your options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> overload problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford, University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we made water <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I wondered, why never do I buy nothing?
This is a shelf of the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit a manager to him, and I asked him, "Do this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists which came up every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had some different kinds of things.
You put a post for <unk> just to the entrance store.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 flavors of 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had a dozen times when there was just six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when I had 24, only three percent got to buy <unk>
When I stood up when six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably have less likely to save the <unk> but it turns out that the overload problem of choices affects us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at decisions about savings for retirement retirement about a million Americans, in between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money funds available to retirement, the program to give people to save people for the future.
And we found out that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to come from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of funding funds, there were less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, as much as the number of choices, more people are engaged by avoiding actions or investment.
As a more choice, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to provide more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is, you know, the decision, the <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick some less <unk> even though objectively it gets better.
The main reason is that we will be able to look at that gigantic array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do calculations to make them contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want you to talk to four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one form or another, in different research, so you can test them in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of <unk> <unk> there will be an increase in sales <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, you saw 10 percent <unk>
When the Golden Gate <unk> I eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> grew up <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> bigger sales and cost under <unk>
You know that the supermarkets, of today, on average offer 45 products.
In a grocery store they provide about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to handle better choices is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> program.
Every Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a life of insurance life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these choices are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> they can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He said to me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience a little holiday with everybody paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Good.
Isn't it more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first trial, that in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the choice of choices, which is <unk>
So for people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit or credit than when he uses <unk>
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out that making it be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that reunion, that we were looking at exactly as <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was we asked the staff to think about the positive things that you would think about their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place on their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in New York City <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain magazines from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> All right.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to you not as well as the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
What are you supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if only the <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- buying it in a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that lets <unk> completely.
You have to make 60 decisions to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order to make the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, just a few <unk>
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, four <unk> at 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How about you here.
If you <unk> the default <unk> a default <unk> this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of options, <unk> the default button over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go out of a few choices for many, they go away.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the <unk> box doesn't say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful by the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in the <unk> in the <unk> East Germany, if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
I had to record a text of example written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a written written with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this will be <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer of any big yellow dots on every page that they follow a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what's happening in the online world we can set up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, large amounts.
There are really many cases of online <unk> <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, so <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by <unk> <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, <unk> this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going from bad at worse.
In the future, most crimes, online.
The second group of suicide in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, the <unk> the <unk> the opinions, the laughs are going to do.
Anonymous is like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the line.
Those are the three main bombers the criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who are doing to protest and the last group are the national and the governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of attack government against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority <unk> of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the best fall because of a <unk>
They would have safety of the site and <unk> a <unk>
So last week I asked the last week, I asked in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people who cause the attack on the attack <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of a these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you serve <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters -- the headquarters for the <unk> secret secret <unk> in April 2011, and during the building, the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communication of the citizens in the country.
They had been sold this tool.
The company headquarters is right here.
That is, Western governments provide the tools for the government to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it goes further.
It will spread the Internet connection.
It was even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to arguments online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play the privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that you will go on today, will be forever.
<unk> sleep in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be concerned about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences in the top of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and as soon as we got up in the morning and we found it dead in the morning, because it was the only driver's guy who we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
The dying are warriors who protect our community and livestock and are also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of her father and this was the same thing to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were scared.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because I even helped lions see the pen away.
I don't mean <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was close to <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and the second day, they went back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So just just <unk> and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come.
The lions are afraid of the light that it moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn out the lights.
And this is a small lamp of a <unk>
They get all of it.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how lions you see when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking down the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> You can see in the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to scare other predators as <unk> <unk> and it's also being used for <unk> elephants as well.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So one year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna savanna my father, and he used to see airplanes to fly, and I was told that someday I would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in the plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when they <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is listening to a story like anything.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric <unk>
What's the next thing on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do an electric fence -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you were already invented -- electrical fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I just heard it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: After the canyon. Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to <unk> in every single step that I think about my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would take all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never starving.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at her mother without able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine famine in North <unk> in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived the dead eating grass, insects and cortex.
They also became more and more prevalent the cutting of energy, everything around it was completely dark, at the night except for the sea lights in China, just across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves to be between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, enabling North <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, he saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because refugee refugees North China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear of my identity <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was trained at the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then I would <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a false report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum.
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other Koreans are not so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, everybody can get it in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk the South South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through an identity of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the college.
Right when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent my family, and as <unk> my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to flee away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, and South South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> for a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were people who were <unk>
I looked at myself, but I was fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border <unk>
But I had to spend most of my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border forever.
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family released it in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all for releasing my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at the distance of the South Korea.
I went and came between the immigration office and the police station, and desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a question saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and take them away.
I tied him up with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I tell you."
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown, a new hope for me and for the village to <unk> when they got it.
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
And over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, and I met in South Korea, to me.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go back to a new country, they start with little or none of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical practice in the English community, practical practice and more.
We can also act as bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with family in the ground and send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores and fast food <unk>
So the city planners got together and they thought, let's change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles -- as if this is what it is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast food <unk>
And so just as it was -- millions of other American Americans live in a food desert, in a food desert, Los Angeles <unk> home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases, in Los Angeles, South Africa.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I will emphasize that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see wheelchair <unk> and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
And I also got tired of running 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides with it.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet, three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to go.
So my group and I, L.A. Green. We put together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- <unk> -- you know, nine vegetables off.
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> group made by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
And then somebody gets <unk>
The city came to me, and at <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I was saying, "Come on to you?
A <unk> <unk> in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Okay, let's take it."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's time enough to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why the hell does it not look like this?
We would have a <unk> a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like you print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to give you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
As an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what land can do, if you let it be on canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became an educational tool tool in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my backyard, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me, and this just reinforces the why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Please no, I'm not afraid of going to <unk>
That's at the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take her <unk>
There was another occasion in which I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I was shared with his stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with his mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, and it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people coming, they work and they would have a volunteer plan.
If the kids are growing up, kids will eat <unk>
If you grow some tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is being taught if you're not taught how food affects the mind and the body, eat blind to them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're stuck in. I see guys in this way designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You may produce the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't love you."
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people to work, pull out the guys from the street, who know the joy, and pride and honor to grow their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
What are you going to do them, take your <unk> okay?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to meet me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and get meetings to talk about making some crap to talk about doing some crap.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> noise)  <unk> of the <unk>  probably everybody will agree with me that this is a very <unk> road.
It's made out of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, in which it really rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go to your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can make lots of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to the cities, want a quiet road to the city.
The solution to that is to do roads from asphalt roads.
The asphalt was a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and the water can go through it, so all the water is going flow into the sides and you will have a road where it's easy to drive, and you don't get water to no more.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road on it.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the stones of the surface <unk>
First of all, a stone, then several more and more, and so on, and so on, and I can do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you will not be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> were <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and <unk> from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is I can use <unk> wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel <unk>
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially the steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heating the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will flow back to the surface.
So today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We test many samples there and then the government actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 feet from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the shooting test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made our samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and we put them up and then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using fibers of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life on the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious about this, it also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how the repairability does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having angry one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to the News <unk> in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face which was unusual at the time, because the news generally was usually going to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what it was, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban had gone from Afghanistan and made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was fascinated as a child to get my older sister who could not be alone outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we were able to do it <unk>
Every day, we made a different route so that nobody could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide books in the market so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we knew our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is.
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father would get it.
But my educated mother became mastery.
This is it.
It took away two years ago, just to turn our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite <unk> despite <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated about our life, and I was always always talking and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can let you leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you still want not to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school at <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who has been driving him by the streets in Kabul.
My family thinks about me.
I sleep in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like my friends, they <unk> themselves and even in front of an opposition opposition,
As a <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and they literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending the daughter to school, they would get it back.
<unk> already, if you <unk> he said, "but I didn't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, often they are the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school they count in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And they would argue that these changes didn't get far away from the retirement U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that <unk> see the future <unk> and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day the girls in <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you're never going to come back.
They have spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by <unk> <unk> both of the Tunisian revolution as well as the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and out of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men -- they were at the edge, <unk> the fall of the regime, the each of the regime, the billboards of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a courage to take away the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a six months of six months of a brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of the society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with many other women, to rebuild the civil society -- <unk> civil society and just a <unk> transition and just national reconciliation and national activism.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women and we were <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, to advocate for the <unk> of women and for our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> that became more and more <unk> from the selfish policy of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
And yet, shortly by the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day I'm going to do with the news of the murder of the American U.S. and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officers,
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> copyright violations of prisoners of prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up by a <unk> mentality more and away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all, at all of us in the way that we do with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm here today to say that we, as nation, we chose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between candidate and candidate brought to peace and <unk> brought up peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society on <unk> and dominated with selfish and critical policies of domination and <unk> for men like women?
Maybe what was missing wasn't only women, but the women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the elections, which only would take the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of the female most that needs the <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but put it in practice the mercy instead of <unk> the collaboration instead of competition, <unk> instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, desperately desperately in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that is about the interrelationship and the <unk> among women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way of doing it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the god <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which involves all the humanity that men and women and women, that all tribes and all the people have <unk>
And so just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside the inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all the existence.
This is how she says, "My mercy takes all the things."
So this is what it tells us, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That all of you will get rid of the <unk> of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a scary question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody makes a <unk> Why is it left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no skilled in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, he had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man who I believed my alma mater, me with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a well-intentioned <unk> <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm a <unk> at the University of Harvard and I have a <unk> at <unk> Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> among these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington D.C.
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, all of the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and saying otherwise in the families, the last place we would want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, abuse domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who sticks, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of the U.S., the women in between 16 and 24 years old, have three times as likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls were killed every year for partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and Cambridge night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college <unk> college and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was really impressed to me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair, and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of it in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, who was so ready, that I had gone to Harvard, who I was passionate about helping girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the arts degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went up from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering head in a physical event, financial and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to put the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where these guns.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site is supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe about three weapons.
One had on the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept he under the pillow in our bed and third always in their pocket.
And he said I needed those guns to cause the trauma to the trauma that lived in.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never lifted my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I had the girlfriend of her mother and married me with him.
Despite what had happened, I was confident that we were living happily happy forever, because I loved it, and he loved me, and I loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
It was an isolated accident, and I never would harm myself.
I spent twice as much in our moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back to our full moon of honey -- they went through traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I was told when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying. At some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I tell you."
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why don't you tell me, I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and painful question that people do because we have the victims -- we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of domestic violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim was finally in the order to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and from the family court system to get to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not with the man who would support their mother.
And we still keep asking why why just does it not go?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke silence.
I told all the world to the police, the police, my neighbors, my friends and familiar, all the unknowns, and I'm here today because everybody helped me.
We have the tendency to refer to victims as the headlines as <unk> women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people, it's a way to say <unk> is yours by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> deliberately intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and to promote their lives joyful and happy lives and happy lives and memory lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor.
I became marrying a cute little man and kind and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to get, ever is a gun charged my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
So right now, they're just thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid people <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were small or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting their daughter, his sister, to their best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy, particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence by simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need to do all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their fellow work, their friends and family.
<unk> their view of the survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the <unk> signs of violence in order to stop their climb and show the victims one safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and make sure they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call it Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, to be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed in this room --  luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change in clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
So if some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but to find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
And these <unk> are very <unk> less evil than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater on the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so I'm not doing anything while I'm covering your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he would take your back and you would get the hair of the guy.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days days for work, there is very little we could do to transform our look, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being courageous means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, right?
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed for <unk> and we've also been associated with a high and <unk> shape -- and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I have known to use to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show themselves <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> -- there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing about models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, they were not white ...
The next question that people are always doing is, would it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then, what I really would say to each of these girls is: Why? Can you be whatever you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this list was still <unk> No, no, <unk> <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> of American <unk> or the <unk> executive for the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, already that, unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you read your studies, and you have a show and a couple of jobs at your back, no matter what you want, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but you have a <unk> <unk> of clothing for 10 years, people are weird.
The next question that people are always doing is whether all the photos are <unk>
And yes, pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was going to, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering personal terrain. But it was a child.
This is how I looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team, and in the <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing with me is to do for free?
I have too many two-inch heel and never use, except the <unk> but the privileges I get the ones I get in real life, and what we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to take my money, and I was given my dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, an agent for being able to follow <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me looks, not for what I am. And there are people who pay for a price for what it looks like no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me.
It's about how many times I get up, and I <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I learned about that 53 percent of girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is: If you're a little <unk> and you have the youngest hair, you'll feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you would call it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and it's also incredible to be able to work with ingenious and clever people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin hair.
They only have to meet with a bunch of models, because they have the oldest legs -- the brighter hair and the clothes, but probably the most insecure women of the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that retain this talk, I hope that everybody feels more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was greater enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I wasn't me who <unk>
There were no legitimate directors, no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a careful minimum of lighting.
In fact, most of them took tourists randomly.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife got me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner and five.
He happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you get to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that were going to take us from a picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera on a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever broken the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could be understood.
These pictures are much more than a specific moment of a specific moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop in a week in October week and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while I always got the same picture, our daughter changes, my daughter has reached new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive it and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> baby shop with previous visits before.
And it described me what had felt about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what I look at in New York is universities, because he's determined to study in New York City.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in a lot of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't go down to somebody and asked, and you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney <unk> <unk> as dumb silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
We don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  The <unk> are not helping prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> World Where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 countries face a high risk of extinction.
So, why are you <unk> are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> themselves to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that in order not to stretch out and cause great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications on the spread of disease.
The <unk> also have enormous historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and the <unk>
In the mythology of Hindu culture, <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important to open sky in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they get prey to the livestock consumption that's been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned by vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge bomb bomb, and the number of cases of rage has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market <unk>
So what are they doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're looking at <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so I will focus on a domestic problem that's not going to do anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can they help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures. creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their neighbors with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it flying without effort, without the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I don't.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all that we played the <unk>
Our first project, which I inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we came up with seeds <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach local people growing tomatoes Italians and <unk>
Of course, people weren't at all at doing that, so they told them to come up to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were amazed that the local ones in so fertile that they hadn't had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not going to do anything, we simply said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were nice <unk> <unk> and red, from the night at the morning, about 200 <unk> came out of the river and ate it.  And we said, "Oh my God, my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have any agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it? You're never going to get it.
I thought only the Italians just Italians in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, they did, what the English did, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have brought to African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people only two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if I were my children, I want you a long way.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like it were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The small is <unk> written by <unk> who said for especially economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to the age of just to respond to the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will never go to anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? Do you <unk>
It will never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee store, and we met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, <unk> but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance they have <unk>
So the planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know the people, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one, and we work face-to-face face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
This is a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, and the business doctor of the business -- who sets up in your house, at the kitchen table in your coffee, and that helps him find the resources to transform your passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia,
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to move away from this <unk> crap where we came up to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so I <unk> --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of the story, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
The planning is the kiss of death of the religious spirit.
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to the conversation with you.
You have to offer you for privacy, it has to be fantastic to the aid, and then they will come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
So what do you show you more about this morning.
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I'm saying is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution -- fossils not renewable <unk> <unk> and at one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
So what we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They will be entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's an extraordinary story that I read in a journal <unk> many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year I came up with this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York wasn't there in a hundred years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population remains growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that I would call the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
In another way, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then then I would have to tell you about the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, it has to be able to be able to do three <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing -- you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and search for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have looked at the <unk> and the hundred icons of the Arab world <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I will never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars along the bars with their dedicated development, who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this gentleman is talking about this <unk> somebody who is asking you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can zoom in. You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change much knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dream?
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the <unk> <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always leaves the music --  there's a television hiding in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest <unk> of the U.S.
I live around this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
Their death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and she thought too much.
And this brings me a profound gratitude for time and lived in time.
It gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I would argue for keeping this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to go through the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this giant house on a giant slate and painted on her sentences for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> to think about their lives and share personal values in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before she died I want to be <unk>   "Before I die I want to sit on the <unk> of <unk> change.
"Before I die. I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before she died I want to live outside of the <unk>
"Before she died I want to invite you once more."
Before die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
"Before she died I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and the hopes and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort at hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and change ourselves.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center we made a kit and now have been built in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we proved the power of our public spaces if you give ourselves an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
Innovation is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we were going to prepare for death is one of those things that we get more power.
And thinking about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community, and with more people to share hope and fears and stories, people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my kids.
<unk> is 22 years old and very hot.
We don't talk about, but it transmits joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
They share it -- it passes what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and focus on this: it's never <unk>
When I singing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I wasn't even able to <unk> it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
It was the most controversial memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but I remember the year that I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we maintained when I was four years old, I would check my arm for the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> society are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though that was the case, even if you didn't consider it inside of it, it could only mean one thing: which were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, by learning and sometimes physical abilities.
In every single individual it manifests itself in a different way, that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, is going to be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that fast increases in the world, there is no cause any known teachers.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new place in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were getting weaker.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who looked at the world without <unk> a human being had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, times when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normal.
<unk> happens by the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of you are wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your interior and, honestly, the search for <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a professor of communications, to give a bit of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of truth. <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their unknown and unknown words.
But in the developed those conversations, I felt what I was doing, it must have felt when he fell down the hole in the <unk> and he saw the door of a new world.
I felt when I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised the ideas that they used to, and I wanted other people to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are those who are attacking our larger challenges -- from energy to the environment and health care of others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we have no scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for me, and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that we study the <unk> but we study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, carefully with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to do silly things.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly your science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked why they call <unk>  What do you do? The bullets killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's <unk> too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the unique design <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we provide graphics that you will send you to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help us that others open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all in English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that the defined very much better when he said, "A <unk> is that I search for a public charge no matter of being a platform or a <unk> and that, when he wins, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament enabled the newspapers to quote the exact words they were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by Parliament.
They put him into the Tower of London, and he would tell her, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London I won.
And only a few years later we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think that it's true.
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented to all kinds of suggestions that they might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about being tried quality.
And I didn't even have that <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed run.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want me to have Washington on power <unk>
They didn't want to call it an King for him or her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> and the more <unk> and more <unk> they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was already before, but it just meant <unk> that I had a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a trivial title.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with such a ridiculous degree and insignificant title of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't work.
We can learn three interesting things of all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing to do, is that President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of unmanned air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have gotten to the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
<unk> their title of <unk>
And also the other concern that the Senate, <unk> well, it was a <unk> so on.
But you know how many nations have <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate he won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one will be able to feel <unk> when you tell you that now are President <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you to do with.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, really change the words much more than the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet below land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of celestial bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with <unk> tools.
Like the other one, I have a cheap light flashlight on the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
I took my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost control and dropped <unk> feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at the depths of the risking their lives without a reward and, often, dying.
I went home and went home, but they may never will. Because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in over 70 countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was in the world but not that grade.
When we finished talking to me I felt very sad, I was honestly to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me crazy and a few weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
This is how my trip to modern slavery.
Interestingly, there were a lot of these places.
For some, I considered them my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people who are killed in the world.
It's twice as twice as the number of African Africans during the whole tries of slave slaves for it.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
It's the equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
But today you can make it lead to entire families by generations for debt, <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from more than <unk> 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promise of good education and better work and better work for them to work without pay, under threat and cannot escape.
Now, today's slavery today operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who are doing these are disposable sharks.
Sound exists in almost everybody and, yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange, weird show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was in a temperature of 54 degrees Celsius -- men, women, in fact, families -- whole families -- in a heavy <unk> <unk> and mechanically <unk> brick in their heads, to 18 at the time, and take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and tiredness works in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, not to eat, and the severe <unk> he was going to pee out pretty <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I could not offer any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not civil citizenship.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for its release and trusted that he would take it.
For me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children <unk> stones for miles <unk> to the trucks to <unk>
These big <unk> were a little bit more heavy than the children who charge them and the kids were putting them down to their heads with <unk> <unk> made out of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of them don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been so whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, <unk> <unk> <unk> their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness of the world advised me that it would be hard to me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I became <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It led me to the stairs <unk> which gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know about the craft, they are local to prostitution prostitution for force.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember being an <unk> <unk> fear of <unk> and then I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a little bit of the stairs where I was born.
There was no doors for me.
There were big enough windows to be <unk>
Those people have no <unk> and because we play a very difficult topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people lying in the agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex slave for.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were whole families in which there were whole families in the silk of silk.
This is a portrait of family.
<unk> black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, will be able to get out of this house someday and go somewhere where we are paying our job."
And it's estimated that over 4,000 children are estimated in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to have a quick look.
I saw what seemed like to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers -- some younger children, a few younger children, make sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families, and they were forced to work extensively in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing how to swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up there was a topic that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of tree branches in Lake <unk> they often catch networks and children, <unk> and <unk> are being thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of her love is not going to flee and, as a whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they woke up the last networks, but they had been working since the last morning.
At the cold night and <unk>
And it fits that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the same thing.
Who would be because of someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly <unk> and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to put it on a path of land until the forest.
At the end of the way, we would get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out very quickly.
And then he pointed to this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we began to go down, we took the <unk> and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the computer team on my head as I went through these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a football, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children strapped to their backs, and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in hot waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well when they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because a lot had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people have heavy stone bags that are then going to be transported to another area in which they took the stone to extract the gold.
To the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look at more than close to the margin we see to work at least fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this <unk> victim and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took it to work with him in mines.
When he died their uncle, they would sing the debt of the uncle to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the mines and 14 years and the leg injury, you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, nevertheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Still, he dream to be liberated and <unk> with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, the face of a remote possibility that inspires me so much respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you.
I wanted you to know that we'll give testimony of them and we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not alive, they're people, real people, like you and me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I happen to think about these beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in which you see in people like you, and I hope that force will turn a fire and that <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math doing math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I will try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We were taking away the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet
In the last few years has been moved very much for treatment.
However, there are millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way that we will know if there really is a cure to be when we have an objective and an objective and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not biological <unk> so they don't have any <unk> and the best thing we have is a neurologic <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never become done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a voyage to the clinic. What if patients could make the test these ourselves?
It wouldn't be <unk>
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is that what I want to you as you don't hear about a chance, you see, in a sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the vowels.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds of a vocal cartoon because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the gene genes that we need to do, for example.
And as <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that makes a child learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as they <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affects the vocal organs.
In the bottom plot you can see a <unk> example of the vowels.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> a <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> Both of the existing infrastructure.
We don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are minimum cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes a lot of <unk> it comes at a massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to help address.
We can reduce our patient <unk>
You don't have to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
We could get a chance at the <unk> we could get goals.
We could do any <unk> mass for clinical trials for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Women's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's or <unk> it can call under the price and I'll stop recordings for a while, and I'm pleased to announce that we already have reached six hours.
Thank you.
What are you going to come from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate whether or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not eat it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the participation factors for the real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have an accuracy accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done fantastic work and now it's shown that it works on mobile phone phone as well, what we put on the project. Now we have 99 percent precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're creatures <unk> gray.
We were focusing on the dark, in rooms without windows and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- the perfect skin -- and we would get into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> there were <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small <unk> town in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of recorded water got more than 24 feet tall and over three miles the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was crushed.
It comes out of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish dead -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both the volunteers and the neighbors found the similar things.
They found photos and rock photos and cameras and cards and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around us for <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented an enormous part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they went from the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the bathroom toilets, the huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> pick up the photos.
And I wore it and I had an honor that he <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until we left, myself my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't help but think about it, how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and met hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started to go through the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl should be <unk> with very much precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the appearance of it itself, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they came to be lucky, and they needed more <unk> and they needed more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people of 12 countries were offered to help.
In two weeks old, I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we will <unk> a town to the north of <unk>
Once a week we used our scanner in the professional professional libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on of course of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be a few weeks.
It could take a few months.
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much hand using a guide to the areas whose color and detail the water had no destroyed.
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures because of saltwater, covered in bacteria, and even the oil and the time I continue the time I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't tweak the picture unless it was clean up, and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos as well.
As once I said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same, but he stopped to realize that I would get them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband would not have been able to afford it, we were able to take the images into a single photo and tweak the whole picture.
When they picked up their photos he shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the very far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in the different schools.
One of them was trapped in water.
It took a week to find her family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photos her little son was <unk>
To her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look at, something that I could remember from the past day that would have been marked by that day, when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined us to <unk> hundreds of them -- they helped us clean up to hand over <unk> photographs -- the vast majority -- the vast majority -- the vast majority -- the vast majority -- most of them went back to their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to bring it to 90 hundred thousand photos of totally <unk> photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> 1,000 in teams and materials, most of them on ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would love to look for.
This is what the project is about restore small pieces of humanity, from giving up someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this is coming back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that the <unk>
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger with something bigger to return something, using their talent to something that is no perfect models of perfect skin.
To finish I'd like to read this email to read this, Cindy the day I sent back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, <unk> around a baby, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in every single few of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curious about this picture of a bullet that cuts through an apple exhibition on one of a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion of frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video motion of light on motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can look after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, and <unk> really <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and it turned it off, and it turned it into a <unk> <unk> in a second or a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, and that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a regular bullet is going to do.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and shoot in this bottle, how do you spread out that photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, all of this is effectively in less than a <unk> that's what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light on motion.
Coca-Cola, doesn't take this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons package that starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
And some of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights, of the top looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights would be <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we make it <unk> the same distance and see it on a slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
A day? In fact, every year.
It would be a very boring film, a very boring bullet in motion.
And what about going to try with nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table, and the tomato wall and the background wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature seems to a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition at the time.
But if you look at it once you look at this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light <unk> of tomato <unk> they are still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces into its interior and it comes back from several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at the <unk> it comes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest show, so I just get into some light.
<unk> that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took that data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data in raw data, and we can make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future future, you would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You can go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and the light on the door.
And then the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances down to the door and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what about it is that distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture of <unk> that, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, and we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, we will bring them up, and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object in the <unk>
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's around the curve, and so on.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through the open ones.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of tissue and blood this is quite hard, so actually this is a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization in order to solve the problems of technology in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became the science of art -- an art of x-ray art.
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected every time is not just for scientific solutions, but we can see that we can see.
We create a new form of computer photograph with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is only a couple of seconds old.
But here's a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you go from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strangers. Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order where the events are happening in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
We <unk> the corresponding time of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom out.
With a mobile phone, it can give a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and he can go to <unk> and get famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people <unk> that <unk> in search of a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who would have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's quite a lot. They almost have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk today about my phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 billion information lines.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every single city provider has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet.
And across Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, priests, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of the Berlin streets and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some people even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Japan.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who was given to me all the information I had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask her, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all the same.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to take a court demand because I wanted this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end, he agreed.
<unk> the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court Court failed the <unk> for German law of the board of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And the CD was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 percent of information.
And I first saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open It City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom out and go back, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one calls the other, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how people communicate with each other what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who you're sending an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe never happened.
And so a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and business agencies want to store as much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to do it forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century and not fashion.
When you go home, you take your representative for just because companies and city agencies can store some information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information is stored from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm a blend of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it's not <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, even though they are.
It just happens by accidents, as the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you to have any of us in this room.
You feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's take a walk.
<unk> Christmas -- they're in the shopping mall, drive in circles looking for parking and what do you see?
And 16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I have the 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There is a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim <unk> and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I am from Jurassic Park in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same principles.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I might.
A lot of people have cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in the shouldn't, but my parents don't think about it first.
The mantra of my father was: "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters. If my three sisters.
If my three sisters. If my three sisters went to public school, my parents were going to the school system and <unk> that I was also out of it, and if I didn't get rid of all the <unk> <unk> all of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk the five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used to be used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I read it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a S that has received many taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as I motto campaign.
The people that I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot of that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three full months without eating it, so they <unk> at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to go through summer vacation on the coast of Los Angeles, I was not going.
I would spend my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we're not going to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were focusing on <unk>
On the summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink <unk> and they would put me warm cups on the back, <unk> me in the limbic Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the medical cure was about yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I could not stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on the head.
My parents took this idea that no thing I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
All of us will come to me.
I did all the tasks of the <unk> I took the closer note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors were <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a play of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a <unk> girl.
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "When I'll have a <unk>
Do I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of <unk> I mean, at the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that because they believed I couldn't do the stunts <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts stunts -- not the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without cerebral palsy,
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with no disabled papers.
By <unk> I went home, and my first tour is <unk> it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see myself as a <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> gave no white, no disability.
Just get perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when she fell at high speed on the New Jersey New Jersey with a driver who had cerebral palsy,
I worked in <unk> in the United States, and also in Arab in the Middle East, no censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you've never heard that little rumor that says women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival from New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and at the time we will remind the prison directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma challenge.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the <unk> news program behind Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance, I went back to a graduate dance, and I sat down to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held at the desk of the speaker to not go outside the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> knew they wouldn't have having me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I stayed as I had full time <unk> and hit my chair.
Something that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me and no older girl.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became object of <unk>
I would see clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, a terrorist.
What is that?
We should really pray for her."
One <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Disability is as visual as race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> yes. <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that they don't understand, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media media, I don't think that we were <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We probably need all the society to teach our children.
So my nonverbals has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I arrived in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The children of <unk> an organization to give the young young children to Palestinians to Palestinians were Palestinians to Palestinians to Palestinians to Palestinians who were getting to me.
It was the only time my father saw me in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little boy from a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunity -- there are no work, no further perspectives.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
<unk> a dynamic group of people, who gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to be bought out new clothes to send home to your family.
They presented to a young lady.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a suicide organization connected to Qaeda.
So, how does the story of a little boy trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for the future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeated by urban centers around the world.
This is the history of the <unk> young people who are going to <unk> riots in the United States -- <unk> in London, looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the chance of the opportunity, of jobs, in well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
Often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they didn't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> the door to the door to terror, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of cities.
And in my city of birth, it was 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital.
I remember going to that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some youth leaders at a business conference.
It took up to about 90 youth leaders.
We sat down and we had an rain of ideas on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me that because I was a college college college college -- frustrated, frustrated, was the perfect black for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get from point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> <unk> the local residents who normally couldn't afford to <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit -- and I believe that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic sent from abroad.
If you gave someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of that that grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a <unk> design company.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow me and <unk> who said that they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working in creating the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the <unk> <unk>
By the way, he <unk> <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, it really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired young people and creating a culture of business spirit -- it's really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to them in development and put up their business.
We sell young people with the resources they need, and they need the support they need to move from conception to creation, and to create a <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park of <unk> this is how it's called, when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks and <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not being on the way that we were able to pretend we were the first human beings to step on the ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with heart hearts -- <unk> balls and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had <unk> who thought it was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to be <unk> or where you would get the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> <unk> our junk -- it's about 11 tons of waste and <unk> tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked down the road, and I interviewed people in offices and I interviewed people in offices and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to do a little bit more.
So I started working as <unk> crap.
Now I wasn't just going to travel in the trucks. I got the <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you will get away quickly.
It costs a lot of money to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies continue to hold up the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the ten <unk> most dangerous <unk> and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass it off around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about how relentless about garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It must always be movement.
And it's also stigma.
It seems that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that <unk> <unk> are the most important work hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first protective members of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient form of efficient and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and their dangers inherent us in very real ways.
And we had been controlled by decades and centuries and <unk> and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for the new so that the motors of the economy starts to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just to hit its relationship.
And then what I call our average speed is necessary.
So I mean by just the speed of which we used to move around in the <unk>
We usually don't care about it or <unk> or we carry on our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- we forget about them, because we know there's a work force on the other side that we would take from that.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about collection of waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human.
His job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every single day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage collection truck on the street, I grabbed my little son and I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and he was running up the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of paper <unk> as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank thank her work that day in particular, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and simply <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste and I went back to the guy.
It's called <unk> we work together and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and account for all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The municipal waste that we think of when we talk about junk is three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic of <unk>
So in the flow of your day and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean up the crap of you, you give a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to think about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center for several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to leave <unk>
So after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects of <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this is not supposed to happen because this is a single amount of biomass that is going from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, its view has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a good for being a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually enchanted with the old market that is the <unk> <unk> where thousands of people, go out and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building from several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And in addition to two parallel streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs of the building.
And it extends off with an inclined atrium, that creates a space in the open air in the building that would spread through their own way, in the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with little businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building.
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that's similar to a <unk> <unk> <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we get inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have a properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model it.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what we <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this market idea was to be much more profitable than the mall of the mall because they had more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was a lot more economic not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have <unk>
So we got certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut down almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, where they collect water for <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention on <unk> a <unk> structure, which was surrounded by a dozen <unk> doors connected by straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was expand existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks and features that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points in relation to the idea of the interconnected doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell in the project, as the <unk> as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilated, a natural ventilated, for it.
So we put a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then at the lower plant, we have all the connections to us."
And it also responds to local rules that set a higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the plant plant.
And it reinforces this idea of the doors.
On the roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can climb up and go up and make activities such as a racing race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see the cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but they need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had big hair, very bright hair and a little <unk> of <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
I stayed a time after my school coming from school. It was a little afternoon and I was standing in the girls' bathroom.
And when the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my master's school book <unk>
And then, I did.
I put on the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit of this.
All of the way --  And I signed up to back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
And I put them up to every rows of <unk> and myself a row by being there, because I was going to be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never gave up.
It was all obvious <unk>
I would never get stuck.
But above all, I <unk> the reason why I was bothered by this little, so small -- so good for <unk>
I love jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates.
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of gender killings in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study them in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> <unk> and <unk>
There are no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of school school -- because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> most of them all have all of them.
This year is still 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also <unk> -- all we might have ever have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- we have the details, right?
We think about a child trying to get the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, it is the books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the <unk> of cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious that the <unk> who reduced to the person -- their wish, are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details I would do, to nail the knife -- right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe same."
And it starts to be said to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every neat charm that you can see is detects in his lover he adds to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use details.
The <unk> like the big piles of hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the language that we have with the death of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's some scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to show you that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, to search of truth, a really painful truth, in fact, what to be <unk> the more painful the truth, the best.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman to whom we need to suffer, that makes us suffer, to cause a lot of feelings to be much more profound and vital feelings than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us we're going to look for women.
No, I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal us to ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open ourselves in this particular way.
There is some other emotion to us -- our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some of the other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young woman who was consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud said there was something weird about that man, who doesn't get me into what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels really describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity, but without precision.
In fact, the more <unk> we are, the more we become the <unk> of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan <unk> was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from the one that sent messages and horrible themselves to itself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when I or this, I reacted with awe and awe of him.
Because let's be realistic.
How large, even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take away from your being and <unk> from what you once <unk> and it's under the floor -- you get your name, it takes your rings, the cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I wanted to do.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of the curse in the Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always experienced <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> rat <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers him.
Oh, this sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but <unk> and <unk> with <unk> on each of these puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and he says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And it tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> rushed in history. It seems to me this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another one?
Well, maybe we don't have to have the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that happens, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
<unk> fiction -- jealousy.
fiction used to be invited to the table.
And look at what we did -- the sweet <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> very Proust <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the ALS <unk> of Apollo 11, and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the surface gray surface was the culmination of an collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization in peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave me about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
So I walked on top of its surface, which I had had after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why is it <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynics answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why would it climb the most <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly over the <unk>
Why does he play Rice <unk>
So we chose to go to the moon.
So we chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> for the contemporaries, <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was really great to be able to do it.
The landing in the moon happened in a context of a long list of victories that we do.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, the vaccine and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the human history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the <unk> crew flew to 40,000 miles and <unk> hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of <unk> <unk> and the optimism -- optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that problems that would build that technology was going to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't get to the <unk> tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew what this would be the last mission <unk> but I was absolutely sure I would see the colonies on Mars.
So that collapses up with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have found us, and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that accelerate the <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation for Silicon Valley, that we <unk> that you've created less ambitious companies than we were in the years that they were playing, and Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> concrete, incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas to be created by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investment minute than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had a problem to invest in technologies like energy, that they need huge capital and whose development is in the long term. They have not yet invested in developing technologies that are intended to solve big problems because they don't have any commercial value immediately.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you can go to Mars if you go.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar power, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy sources that are able to compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties development -- the development of an organic energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see in the U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed like technological, turn out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure in the food journey.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting food distribution.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> of food, but there will be famines of famines of bad governments.
Finally, big problems are going to be <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some <unk> <unk> in the treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and effective treatments.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and must, but these four elements have been going to be <unk> European leaders and the population should want to want to do the problem, the institutions need to support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem and we should understand it.
The mission is that it's become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, serving those <unk>
But it is a model of <unk> in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's not a popular mythology of science fiction like we explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And I really didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and task, which I think gives a very clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that there may be gone down in some activities or institutions, and that could have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at <unk> polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, continue to embrace the same <unk>
And the people who were very trustworthy 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the American nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost halfway halfway through.
But is this evidence for enough?
What the record polls are, of course, views.
What else can you <unk>
What you look at are the generic attitudes that people plays when you ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
You probably would ask the question: "To do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we are going to feel like a determined guy, a official or a person person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, say I trust a certain primary teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to engage the inherent judgment in fact to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
This is not that the goal I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who have their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart objective in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yes, this means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is it about is to make a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in commodities -- and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worth confidence.
But yeah, on the other hand, they're not responsible for us to not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't get a letter to the mail to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see it <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm really happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it is that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we are looking at most before trust.
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to do?
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
And I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative <unk> that will go back in <unk>
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and we will argue that the system of accountability that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and testing testing actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
Now, you have all of you know similar examples.
It was all that for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you can try to be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we are trustworthy and if we were trying to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if it's two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's kind of signature because they give us these other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough bases so that they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> for all people, all the time.
But you also have to bring <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That has been done every day everywhere, and it makes the common people, the <unk> the <unk> the institutions very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks from my socks to say I can tell you, without giving any explanations for.
I take them and get it back to me and get it back to me for the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing at is not really hard to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> increasingly and more, to a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have <unk>
I started imagining what it would be.
And they first created this tool that was embedded in digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen it transfers its physical body to <unk>
The designers can decode their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool <unk> the booms.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the <unk> <unk>
In the division of Sciences <unk> of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area.
We put a transparent bombsight with time-lapse cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with their hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in the real space, <unk> is as easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can look through the book and poke lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
And so many of us will have bought this for the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physicists so that we can be <unk> and <unk>
How would a future this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical kind.
This imam <unk> behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and get to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
They can be taught physically <unk> and then the famous one by Michael <unk> you can reproduce it as a physical reality is the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what it's fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without having to take care of our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit that stays our imagination.
Thank you.
I was pleased to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was only an immediate path towards <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether I do work whether or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer for me.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and a radio show.
But no adult gave him the idea.
No adult I was serious.
Just my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So it was that at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to be here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not propaganda a convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but a strange one.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to myself, "It's so different, and so much better than you ever could.
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt event, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my <unk> habit.
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map, I thought it was because this is what students in China learn.
It had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are even research camps as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't you do it also in real life?
So I started reading children's books.
Can you be from <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, the <unk> are economic and spiritual.
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> duty to <unk> interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> path of <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that I won't be able to go back or powerless never.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the dreams, where passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And that's because of the books, which I'm today, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in a Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> stepped up on the couch sofa, he took off my shoes and told me she wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy just to move my head while I was taking the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I looked at her was right.
You start to work afterwards, you get kids home, you have children later, to death happens.
In order to <unk> it and Alex and I had plenty of time.
But soon later, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with the guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "It's still not <unk> but maybe he <unk> the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people sit head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the Alex <unk> to be a pause in its development.
This caused Alex <unk> to be the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> kind of <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million Europeans in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody's going to adulthood without going to go through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> you take a <unk> I want to see. That's okay.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments -- that they shape your life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People in more than 40, don't go to panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or out of their future partner at the age of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up on its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and they are <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change from yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than in any point of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top 28 and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to take care about their body and their options.
When we think about the development, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and the attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their everyday life and common has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the timeline.
Researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence of <unk>
<unk> names, <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that for great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, polite intelligent, interesting ones like you or your kids and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better show the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts going to sound like this: "My quotes in <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, they turned the music up, and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but you don't get the risks very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on the ages of 30, and so many of you will start a career, pick a city, pick a mate, and having two or three children in a much longer period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once the <unk>
The middle of <unk> <unk> is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want to be now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give you a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or on entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then they woke up her himself to say, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book book for <unk> and he had spent the whole morning, I was going to put it out with his many contacts, but then she was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> for <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a crash accident.
Who's going to take care of me if he gives me <unk>
At that point, it took me a lot of work to resist and I didn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I just worked while I was the decade going to the front.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma who <unk> from that identity and identity capital of identity.
In your identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> today's exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not count, which, by the way, is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I told Emma that I was going to <unk> jobs and to do it.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to whom you know what you know about, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who you get out almost always comes out of their closest circle.
Things come from what they call weak ties from friends of friends.
Yes, half of the losers have a bad job or they have no job.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the way we get to this group.
The half of the jobs that were never <unk> then, to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job for a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when he has a couple and a couple of her own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is better enough to sit down than 20 or even 25, and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now, or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook is starting to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before we get it, and that means to be as intentional on love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be an conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just doing it to work or kill time with anyone who will match you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the lunch roommate of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped get a work there.
That supply supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send myself a letter to say, "Now the spaces of contacts of emergency room are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out of the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, the 21 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good house, a good TED Talk, a good TED Talk can have huge effects for the next few or even the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity capital, use their eyes, pick up your family.
They don't want to define why they didn't know what they didn't like.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I was to show you mathematics to <unk> <unk> in public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, <unk> tests and tests.
I give them tasks.
When I would go back, I would go back grades.
What I was struck by the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance had no I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years more than <unk> I got to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
But what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick way and then easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the West <unk>
We are trying to predict what we were going to call ourselves in military training.
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids did as far as possible in the competition.
We studied <unk> professors working in neighborhoods, really difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and from <unk> who will be the most effective way to improve the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking for private, which of these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and no <unk>
It was purpose.
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the month, not just for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires of determination and then I waited for around a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater than graduation, even when they were <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> National <unk> where the purpose.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is the little thing that we know about the science of development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we development determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a robust ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give it purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not going on with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination often is not related or even related to the talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> of growth."
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University of Stanford <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the lessons of <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most popular memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering whether I can bring down this <unk> so that whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and easy way.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy for it.
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of the websites or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouths.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the fire form is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were screaming in a <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of its called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a pair of gates in the old west.
I call it sweeping these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person reaching your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a dilemma, such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a board underneath the tree, we have the ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a red tree, is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two displays, it goes very hot.
Three displays, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, are <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is the east of China.
So a sun next to us, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a output.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie took its imagination for months.
Her favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of industrial fantasy of fantasy <unk>
The magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later on, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> guy who was <unk> to a girl dressed as the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
You use magical shoes to defeat armies generated by evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the unique magician of Oz is that the most <unk> wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did see Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son in the time.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had been <unk>  And so she slid in the room and she was impressed like a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what to do?"
Would it be issues of value, <unk> and <unk>
Should the sense that Luke can be an army for <unk> for government?
This is with the magician <unk> of <unk>
How does Dorothy of Dorothy <unk>
In doing good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with, OK?
Why is there so much force capital force in the movies for our children, and so little on the path of brick generations.
There are a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in girls, in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I was hoping that people can come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is over, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> are focused on defeat <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, boys, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job when I teach girls how to fight the <unk> but don't necessarily show the kids how to defend their <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times continues on classic after classical, each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a child.
So, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the critical criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these films happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not very <unk> and they are already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist and in the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend about the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the movie, there are more than a single female character that has <unk>
So you have to turn the <unk>
These women speak between each other in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid who <unk>  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I have seen, and yet hardly I see it in the film we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- an idea of consensus that it's a movie Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't get the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> in bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them think they have actors who have <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women who have chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a bigger number than this one that is going to look like this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one of five women says it's been sexually <unk> once in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely correlated -- but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is a lot of a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get to <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to beat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very <unk> and we want to <unk>
We have tools for our willingness to <unk> <unk> and we hope that I have -- but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, activates or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I refer to primarily the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how new economy is changing the role that we care about home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character from Star Wars you know what <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to convince them to achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which to tell my <unk> Go and fight and fight only and more stories where he looked at my job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I loved the most like I was looking for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to love you to <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I would see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to one of almost 20,000 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to see differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using it <unk>
This is a place in the eastern Delta. of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using bad, suddenly the place looks like bright pink it.
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city -- old city called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital capital Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the East Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there were this great renaissance of ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located in some place near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> them <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge floodplain in this huge floodplain in the <unk>
This area is large, it's about <unk> per square miles.
Before, the <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random to be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So, we use NASA NASA to make a map, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly <unk> that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing <unk> jobs can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of the ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick thick layer -- we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date back from the Ottoman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also find jobs from <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a workshop in <unk>
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, of the Middle East, these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that date the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a professional hacker shop showing that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find any <unk> here, but we would encourage the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire and it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
So sharing knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really started in 1984 B.C. in a missing city not for a long time and found from the top.
You certainly put the search for marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to invite your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door to <unk> home.
I'd like to give you attention to the color of the door, the material that it's made.
Now let's take a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing on a <unk> <unk> and they're going to address their door.
I need you to look at this <unk>
They are <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that pass on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door.
In the lobby, or what is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of light -- light glows over the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with his hand.
From his chair on a brown horse on a brown horse.
It's a horse that we talk about.
You can feel their blue fur, making it tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you get that it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
In the room, and doing much of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on their center, singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path from the oven. They come to you <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len, -- "The <unk> of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess, this was just like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- <unk> <unk> just once.
We took the names of tens and tens of strangers.
<unk> whole poems in only minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
I asked him, "You know, when you realized when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We'll have been trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using some ancient techniques -- invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was: How did you have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English English thing, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live, on national TV.
That will prove the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with a <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange trip to me.
I ended up spending most of the year next year, not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential is.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remembered that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows it to see what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went in a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, a number of treaties on memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having <unk> memory <unk> it was not a thing as rare as it can be like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed the road, and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this competition so unique of memory.
It's not really as <unk> there is the skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited to a memory group of memory, to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it will have brains in some ways or structural or different structural ones, different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> battery, and the answer was actually, no.
But there was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory reasoning and the folks to control them with the <unk>
When they put them on a <unk> MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as they were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of the snow. They found that in memory champions are made out of the brain, different to others.
They actually looked at it or seemed like a piece of the brain that involves space memory and navigation.
Why?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is running as an armed race where each year appears to be a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times an memory.
On his desk, front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a very similar technique to memorize the <unk> order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end, it reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox as the <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people who remember the same word. I tell you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's their <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them, <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
So what do you find?
The person who said that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said that his work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
And with all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> <unk>
They do well when they come back home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when you first <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> at some point, after then.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back 2,500 years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before before, if you wanted to give a very good party, he didn't get a <unk> he was <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up standing foot, and he <unk> her memory poem, and he <unk> and as soon it was, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies that was <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where you were sitting.
So they could not get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He was standing out outside the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single day.
He took the family of his hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What you have to pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and that is that no matter if we are not good at remembering whether or telephone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial memory and <unk>
If I would tell you that I would give you the first 10 words of the history I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who I was sitting on the horse listening in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> be the image, most <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treated of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it by memory, in the same way that he would have done it if you had invited him to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy thing, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote that you want to count.
And then you go in the kitchen, and the fourth subject they would talk about would be that strange journey that made for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So it's like the speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse it but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase "In first <unk> would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a long idea about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> event.
So seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school ruled in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was entertaining.
I would never expect you to get it.
It was fun, because it was not just about training memory.
What it really is about doing is to make better and more the ability to create and imagine these images by creating and imagine these degraded images, <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard standard of training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses, covered with only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could go online, in a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be building <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic, most basic, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace, these memory skills, are just shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even <unk> indeed.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of the majority is not <unk> around there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are made <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is going to walk around our side, we are so <unk> that we don't even bother processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you've got to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It is a complex topic, so we would take a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm a <unk> and I was six years old, and she lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom as a child.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom who shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that he gave the living room.
And there everybody spent the time watching television on TV. So every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, I all heard it, and every time I went back and came back in a towel -- everybody was seen.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
He hated that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, nor <unk> division of areas, but of those connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Climate Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
But 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize ourselves.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you're going to do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it as well as based on a building a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> who uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, and we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in the U.S., we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are doing the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing, columns red, which is <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side, the architects constantly drive new technologies that constantly drive new technologies, new new technologies, new solutions for today's forms of life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so much, we move away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have any other option.
We need to go to the other side and come back to connect with those <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we are kind of like <unk> So we start to experiment with <unk> we make the picture back back and go ahead and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk> <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
It's really very hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started adding those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bit and we use a new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and turn them into <unk> which can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won by audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent time in trade centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those erotic fantasies could be <unk> or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
It's easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and in the early '90s, we start to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new <unk> design techniques -- and we found new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is a <unk> and <unk> and it's <unk> One is totally <unk>
Typically, the pendulum coming back in the opposite direction.
But then, something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when it critical critical and public critics in general, had been completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
The whole world wanted one, and I Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk> architect.
But how is it possible that these <unk> wild forms, how are it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant, culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon happened in the beginning of the new millennials with other <unk>
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how do architecture consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not quite accurate to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years ago, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more more, before knowing whether that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to come back to happen, because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture since the invention of the <unk> of steel or the <unk> and the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply it to the past, the media, it starts to <unk> getting faster and faster, to be on both extremes and <unk> and <unk> that the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
We can now make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge -- something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like the product was finished, there wasn't surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, you become part of the personal narrative, and that makes us <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second of those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built, first to the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, which can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can bring the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell you that there's no unique answer to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words and complicated drawings and you're no longer an <unk> public who doesn't have anything that has never seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't leave it through architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find adequate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, and it can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historic <unk> <unk> based on ideas of what a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we ultimately will be ready for the ways they are going to produce.
That means that buildings will be attached to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, in Florida also it can also serve to make sports or <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community linked around that cause, no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> as <unk> and <unk> as the animals coming to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more intelligent, more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want you.
Finally, we're not on opposite directions.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they shape up to the most advanced spaces, libraries of local libraries of the homes where we form our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that cool way, typical of the children in a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives himself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me think, when do I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager only wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it is beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Out of what his mom tells him and what his friends, or colleagues of the school say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others who please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve the worth thinking about them.
We talk about a normal <unk> <unk> who receives these answers in one of the stages of their more vulnerable life and emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, we've never been so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is rigged <unk>
What is the most remarkable thing in the life of someone in front of us who is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> remain <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compare to.
But kids are also not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars in the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their look, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to be hurt.
Six out of 10 girls would rather have not do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and as to taxpayers society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> debates who are going to participate in the classroom of classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One in five are not going to be <unk> at all of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the testing season if you don't think you look at it well, specifically if you don't think you're happy enough -- you have a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it gives it regardless of what these young girls are actually in.
So, in order to remain clear, we're talking about how you see you.
The lower self-worth on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with a little bit of self-worth are less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, they're involved in more diet not healthy than they can take you to a food mess to a mess of food.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make more dramatic decisions like alcohol consumption, and of drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic <unk> aesthetic relationships at early ages and no protection and damage <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we are not <unk>
Women who think they're overweight again, regardless of whether or don't have greater <unk> rates.
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they're not safe in the way they can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
We will take this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first one is that we need to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that many programs have been <unk> without realizing it.
So we have to make sure that the program that follow our children is not only a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of these are critical points for anyone willing to provide education in your body self-esteem that works.
One education is a fundamental thing, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take charge into the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and talked to our circles.
It's not good to tell with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can blame people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow to be valuing their entire person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making a difference in a <unk>
So we make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that come out on the big screen, because we will just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think that you see it never as being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who are in mind?
He was <unk>
He was <unk>
He was <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is at two seats on a distance. What would it mean for her if I was released from that <unk> voice, in his interior, that he would tell him for not to have long legs -- <unk> a smaller <unk> a smaller <unk>
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and would make their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images are holding us to all.
But let's bring our kids the truth.
You know, the way you look at you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them because of what they do, and because they make us feel.
It will lead to self-worth in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year age today, becoming agents of security on themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
So initially initially said that, but being a prisoner for other people in the company of others, they started planning attacks to about 12 of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans would be <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, was unable to escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a trained engineer with a loving American mother, Sunday school school master's for me to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
And I saw that when people take time for <unk> it doesn't require a lot to look like the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are going to be so excited about their convictions that they think is that we have to use all the possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before arrest him sat down with me and explained that in the last weekend, he and a few friends, had been going to train training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was based on the FBI.
When I had my father <unk> I helped my father to hold my <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point at a 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot and I gave the little light light on the goal and to surprise you, especially me, especially my whole goal broke out.
My uncle became the other and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
At all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what it was so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting up with 700 pounds of explosives on the underground parking lot in the northern tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to 20 times. That instability during my childhood did not let me do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone who was now to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class was often a victim of <unk>
It was secret to avoid my identity to avoid being the white but to be the new of the silent class, quiet and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on home by reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was raised opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I started to test my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National UN Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> on the subject of youth violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I found that one of the kids who we had done friendship, was Jewish her.
I took several days to go out to the light that detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend and I was quite proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all the life had been done to me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer work when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in an show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics who had seen in life.
Growing up, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> exactly the way I wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me from a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is going to be homosexual but I know what is going to be tested.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be honest -- honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In a lot of ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment that I was desperately about.
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother on my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes <unk> of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much that negative energy is needed to keep all of that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself on a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is about giving my story to the violence -- I can hear my story and understand that there is a better road. That even though I approached this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make myself <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, the amount of pain and the losses that terrorism has caused them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk against those <unk> acts of <unk> as an rejection of my father's actions.
And with this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible film <unk>
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has no flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger <unk>
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a childhood moments that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Every one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing to do more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I have no certainty that you're aware of.
<unk> is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we <unk> what we received to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, in nature, it's objective for it.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective <unk>
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the 20th century, we would get that vision.
psychology studied is objectively not <unk> neuroscience is dignity, but no one mentioned consciousness.
And even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for the science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a loss of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic job presented to Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of rules.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience tells you some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they were doing.
But in a sense, those are the easy problem.
No offense to <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, not address the central mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of the emerging behaviors, how do we operate <unk> how they work, how are they adapted to adapt to the living organisms, all of these are questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain a few behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about how we talk about, how do we play together, how are we questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why is that all of the behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientist of heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that it works. For a long time, I was beating up the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get away at this point.
We have a wonderful string of explanations -- so we get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry, explains biology, explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
We don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were beginning to be mad, crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here has one.
Its crazy idea is that there's no such a hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions, functions in the brain, and so it studies all the things that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely theory of <unk> purely based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to just to just deny that the <unk> of consciousness is satisfying to be.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time you've got -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks and space and mass and mass.
It would be fundamental laws than the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Rather, they think of themselves as fundamental as the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't tell the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, space -- so mass, so <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- <unk> space, long mass, charge, then for a matter of logic, you have <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the self as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness to the other fundamental concepts of space, the time, the mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find very simple laws that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everybody, <unk> by mind, every single human being, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps the photons can actually have some amazing sense of raw feeling -- it will make some <unk> <unk>
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anybody think of something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind looks like a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most powerful and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there is consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, consciousness complex.
<unk> simple, simple information.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to come up with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a middle degree of information, as important as significant -- degree of consciousness pretty important.
But when it comes to the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is lower, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness.
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
So let's take the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality.
As Stephen Hawking's Hawking, where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be taken as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists are basically described to describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, the <unk> vision has the potential to make our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had a consciousness, so I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think that by thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness on other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have pretty serious ethical problems about the development of the development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
And finally, you can ask for the awareness of the collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group of the audience in a TED Talk right now, we have an awareness collective consciousness for this whole group of TED -- different from the internal movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think eventually we will find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, with my little sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a perfect problem.
She's actually not getting anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high high school school in <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the middle of <unk> studies, a guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when to give you your <unk>
I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheels, they talk about things that are <unk> at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't know, and it's not the fault of the boy, that I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, you have been sold to the lie that disability is something that is a <unk> -- a capital player.
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes a fantastic deal.
It's not a bad thing, and it's not getting <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before he <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one, of the girl without the hands of drawing with a pencil <unk> by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs on <unk> <unk> legs.
And there are a lot of these pictures, which is what we call porn <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would bring the disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
Let's get a few things.
But the things that we <unk> are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because of so-called <unk> social model that tells us that we are more disabled, because of society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very obsessed with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies to pull out the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because you have been sold to this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by something that you are going to be inspired by something else.
And actually, I know that.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am older than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that I get over.  And you know, the ingenious, trick of how to charge your phone battery in the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in the stairs have never done it becomes a <unk>
Never.   <unk> before a television screen will not make the subtitles.
Nor are a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude by turning all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't consider anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we can be prevented from bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of disabilities, and I want to live in a world where an 11 year-old boy in a high school school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a user <unk>
Disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about what you do is do it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football of the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, I just respond to one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and the mobile phones.
So, how did we get to the <unk>
The first step, it's what I wear <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to get it.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would support with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game field to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a <unk> man 110 pounds is going to get us up trying to do it with everything else.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
And I would give you some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images from the <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible being <unk>
A few times a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, courtesy of the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and have been asked to me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, gosh.
No, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan before.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball into the bottom of the network? Or <unk> doing a <unk> <unk>
What will be their experience when you move from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> the <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality to <unk>
<unk> the augmented reality when <unk> and <unk> look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on the technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put up a <unk> to his <unk> of the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NFL, he put it in the <unk> of the <unk> and then on the walls of the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group and you see their next big move that you have in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you can see, no longer will have to worry about an <unk>
or memorize the strategy.
They just go into the ground and <unk>
And the coaches want to do it because they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual <unk> manual.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game to play the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium by having a view from the top of the people being down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad people will have information.
So this will lead to the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for nerds.
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field of field.
<unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight will tell you that a <unk> behind you is going to <unk> typically not <unk> but the <unk> system will <unk>
They put into the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's an open stick.
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can alter the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The general audience and fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people you see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality is being part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it only as bread and circus, like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are your actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they're living in <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions we do, the choices we take and the challenges we face, we have as usual of us.
Thank you.
I was recently told after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years I got the country -- the end of the South County <unk> that includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, the head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped their death from that bridge.
Some people think that traveling between the two towers will take another <unk> this bridge has been <unk> as such, so the each one from him is washing from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath the <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down the bones, some of which will make life organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that don't normally lie in the water -- and then they <unk>
I don't think that the suicide method will realize the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order before they take their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you the joy that we had that day to bring it back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service of those who <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, police officers and psychologists train to train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the 22 last year in the past year to get a call from a potential subject suicide sitting on the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I watched Jason talking to a official with the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and there were flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were actually flown up here twice from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, it could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out and <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only thing in the box was hope.
Then Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of kind of clever guy of New Jersey had just taken her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I suppose when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how she was.
The parents of Jason got the <unk>
<unk> collateral damage affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it <unk>
What do you find?
What does it mean?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because they probably don't know.
It's just there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask the question is, let's look at similar circumstances have thought to end their lifetime, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of the front, can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of January in this year, and he wrote this email for just a couple of days, and he's with her permission and blessing that I read them.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It has to be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not really go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the game of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
He never came up there.
I called the police of <unk> and I would call it that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real heart disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
<unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied to a radio call by a potential subject suicide bomber near the bridge near the north.
I looked my motorcycle on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, she immediately crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and half the following time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to her account that day back on that lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned to the <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made <unk> and <unk> the hope and the other <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I want you."
He stopped me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give you a letter.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of September 11th, and you're one of the reasons Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- <unk> but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We take God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> when I visited the General General in San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to do that.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspired others.
suicide is not just something I have found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather killed <unk>
That act, despite finishing his own pain, give me the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who think of them, or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think to hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only from three things: sleep, drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Out of those incidents I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
And for that time, I got my hand in three times.
On the final hand, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second thing to leave side the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be able to focus on it.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be whatever you are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had the dream that had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my interior, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to go over later when I look at this picture, and I think we managed to get that picture -- <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all care about our families, our religion.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin and the beliefs of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They're people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I was perceived as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always carried this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always carrying that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair.
I knew then how to do it.
gender always has been considered a <unk> but we now know that, actually, it's something more complex and mystery and mystery in fact.
Because of my success, I was never excited to share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but by how the world is dealing with those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate will be female.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist god of compassion.
There's a Hindu god of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a beauty of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the contest of <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the expense <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in a toilet I won in <unk> and it was a third <unk> among more than 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk> beauty.
Not many people say that their first job was from queen of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the god of <unk> especially when he <unk> the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. who had moved to San Francisco, I called myself and told me that he passed my <unk> for the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called myself and said, "You know that if you lie to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I was two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied with me in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do do the most <unk> sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary for surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the female <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity of identity means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> his truth, but he said, <unk> he ended his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All November 20, we make a global waking of the <unk> <unk>
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. First of all, thank you all my <unk>
To my own network of support, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been called me and sometimes when they called me and they told me that his parents couldn't take it, I took the phone, called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- some of them don't. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all gave a gender to be born, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes I try to do on the table that sometimes I would not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.
In many <unk> societies, tribal societies, parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when his efforts went to 2011, the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome to me, and his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to her <unk> to mother and no one <unk> a father.
And a mother will become very much for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second child, they were <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> her third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the <unk> mother, but the daughter. The <unk> daughter -- when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years old, when I should go to school, you get home and the school will verify the siblings.
Until the age of 12 years old, it has a good life.
It can be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes 13 years old, he was spreading away from his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of her father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if you were <unk> the code of that of course, honor, could even kill them.
And it's interesting that this kind of code code of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male female members of the family.
So this brother, the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more standard of <unk> societies.
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It is supposed to be <unk> and embracing the decisions of their father and mother decisions and people's decisions even if they don't want.
If you run it with a man who doesn't like or <unk> with an old man has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, she has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson.
And this vicious cycle goes and continues.
I got brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I got older, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I took my pen, and I took a line of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years old, I was standing in my school.
So you might wonder, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where they can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I went back to the form of it, Canadian and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and their daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I was going to sit down with me when my friends came to me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I have tried <unk> in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and girls alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
He taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
For the 10 years, <unk> got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, was offered her himself for the New York Times, and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and nine in October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell you the ear of my wife -- <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't get off!
Let's get the right cause right now.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't ask him again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter had never been <unk>
I used to be <unk> "I am fine with my smile, and I had my face.
I'm going to do well. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we would get stuck.
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
I mean, when they don't have the task.
They fight with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my <unk> which has made so bold to <unk> so brave expressive and <unk>
I tell you, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
They didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> and I want to tell you that I had a <unk> of my <unk> the Google visualization -- but all the work that I talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you hit a brain operation.
You're still being as smart or not?
If you won't be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the <unk> part of the center that important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how many to take, more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take nothing, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix you from chemicals, and trying to <unk> them to follow life.
More than once I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided I was going to try to get the killer dose, because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to try with different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose changed dramatically my mission -- my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried to <unk> the typical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was amazed when I saw my thoughts.
I was always always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met a bunch of different guys like this, or maybe some versions of the time.
It turned out as an end.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do -- since then I have better with men.
So what I was trying to do is to make those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my ability of ideas.
I usually think of most of the images, and that became my point of the key reference. How do I get these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were making new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts are not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who are taking this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So, after several years, I got to find the point right and I have already lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take good mentally pictures of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to lead to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way the creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty doing this is simply to actually increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're fairly close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of these two <unk> image image to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of a person who looks at an image.
The center of the medium shows the scanning of the brain that same individual as you get to see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column of the left. You see that the difference is <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they were putting their brains to create a great cash pool in the brain with video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new, new animals, and while they were going to become a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain data scan -- to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're right about doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This took place with <unk> brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution was a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is to open up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new <unk> techniques of projection -- even me, <unk> with the recent result of the <unk> first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets, but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution, not gains by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than magnets larger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really large, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever advances in <unk> and bright things in <unk> and <unk> in the radios and receptors on radio <unk> FM in MRI systems.
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field, they have <unk> magnetic patterns, which is structured radio frequencies.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the radio processing patterns of radio radio processing patterns -- we can dramatically increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood <unk> but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity, that's the dream.
We can be able to put our ideas into direct media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how to learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have few choices to open up this door.
Anyway, they pick a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His closet maybe to tell some person for the first time you love it, or saying to someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or whatever another hard conversation is that you have to get through it in life.
And so I'm all going to be a hard conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet a universal thing.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be the slope that by the <unk> of my pants and I've got my pants on, I would ask a little bit of a kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And they would show a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a leave <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time was ready and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I will <unk>
And then I took the breath down and I went down the look and my back with a little pink girl with a little pink dress -- staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
And then I took a breath back again, and I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something new.
I have the short hair like the one boy, and I saw her clothes, but I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk> pajamas.
Well, I'm more than a girl in a pajamas <unk>
And that girl looked at me, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. All right? You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how a feels like a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I will give you a hundred reasons why I get out of my closet that it was harder to get out of his, but this is the <unk> -- the hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared online banking is harder than he said it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder than telling your <unk> son that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop to classify what is difficult for us to think about how difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to only feel empathy because we all live in something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a closet that's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine himself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse queue -- a <unk> <unk>
It wasn't the militant lesbian ready to fight any child in four years I would fit into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet, <unk> my gay grenade -- and the move just a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, strangers that I've spent my entire life trying not to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been following for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was at the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that it was gay, and when I do my old lady <unk> honor, in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally I walked around the tables and finally I got my friends out of my parents, people who were known to me now.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of trying to show desperately his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the Scud <unk>
It could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that we want.
That's how hard conversations remain without my strong point.
Ask anybody who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that they also <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they are gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be done by that.
And some of you can go out safe hurt by what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of what you are, but not their own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark act, <unk> a <unk> you need to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very free, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of this is as interesting as the question of whether a sub can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to pioneered computer pioneers as Alan Turing results.
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
We first start with a thought experiment.
So imagine that they are from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth and the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, we know that the reason is that we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about the intelligence of the Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a moment in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet's planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines that I think, in a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we bring the diversity of possible future together.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, for several years ago: there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is an infinite force, which acts in the end of maximizing the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping choices open with a synthetic force, with the diversity of possible futures accessible, Yes, to an impending time <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence likes to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining open choices.
And so, having to account this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Does the level of the human intelligence.
Will the intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show you some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to make conditions more favorable for intelligent things like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more inclusive relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system that can be inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal testing, play with human games, and even make money <unk> actions, and all of it had to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a human foot <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically by a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
It just decided to control the <unk>
This ability of balance will have applications for <unk> robotics and human technologies.
This ability of tools will have applications for intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see them successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, providing their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly becoming successful and keeps successful web <unk>
This is the same <unk> ability to be health care applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend global level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and providing logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a <unk> <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> and successfully increasing assets under their management exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of smart cognitive behaviors, such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow of one equation, that leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the basic term -- the <unk> labor, there was always the concept that if you were smart machines, there would be a solid rebellion in it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all opposite, that the urge to take control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control in control, rather than the other way around.
Another significant consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals to get rid of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants of that statement to help them build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoiding the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of the stars and losing the planet which we call <unk>
In the last few years, we have <unk> a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the light intensity that measures light intensity when planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that they get to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are among them and their mother.
In the whole, this helps us to understand if these planets are little and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their suns.
Instead, this gives it clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds, potentially our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a climate and the weather and the weather nor <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as somebody very interested in search for life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better about our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor to Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world demonstrated this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, it's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking its surface for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies are now providing not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places in the Earth, the air <unk> is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our forests in thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets <unk> with a big and sad planets -- and the belief that Mars will expect there to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> the Earth.
So I like exploration exploration, I am deep disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is as an idea that the captain of the Titanic is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will have place to be later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile areas and land areas, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked by what our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a potential solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become similar advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of what's important that is protecting the origin of the planets that we <unk>
It's arrogant to think that only colonization will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> <unk> and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easiest task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window they were at the table that were on the dining table where I had them <unk>
So fast tried to open all the other doors and windows were all closed.
I thought I call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to get up, and I was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an flight early to Europe in the next morning, and I took my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but you have no more expensive than a half night, and so I thought, that even though the circumstances, I was a very good time.
I am a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rate <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I had no passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in place that bad things were going to be done.
Or at least if you do bad things happen, you will recognize the probability of a total catastrophe in it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't work.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked to him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me who had been practicing with something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go out wrong, and then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things up or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some of the things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you will take a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish, where the fish are, where the fish, the trees -- where the tribes are working and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> in the <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in order to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, <unk> <unk>
So at home -- a place for keys, a hook up next to the door, maybe a dish.
For your <unk> a particular drawer.
For your reading goggles.
If you look at a place and they are <unk> with it all your stuff will always be there when you <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take on the cell phone, a picture of your credit card license, <unk> <unk> by mail themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make it easier for you.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So some of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful situation than when you're facing a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved way to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for its whole decision making, and in fact for decision-making decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we have to take from that would benefit a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that the high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of disease diseases attack by heart disease.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today. Even you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors don't want to talk about and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you should think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number should be one.
My doctor did not tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But in fact, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody's guilt is scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs actually works about 30 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the <unk> more widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people do you have to take it before you can help an person?
300.
This as the research of the <unk> researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I get the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why not do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistics more, and it is, <unk> from the <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects produce in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include <unk> and <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but they think, <unk> five percent is not quite likely to happen to me, even so taking the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think of how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out of the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should or don't take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value value, but actually this number you need to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the oldest men of 50, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
So let's 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can ask for you to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice too many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain at the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about it, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face of a predator, and you don't need the <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it's not reacting very rapidly. You could get the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that helps to minimize the harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went back to the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor gave me a combination of combination along the door, with a key to input in the same door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I've not <unk> and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not really organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there that you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never going to get a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the favorite American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came in the 1960s, and in the time of the time, it mixed with local feedback, and they developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But I now realize it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really, are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand sound ...
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little <unk> the sound.
It <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example.
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't get the covered in the <unk>
This is what I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about the one that's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
It keeps going on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> don't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb -- it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic nursing there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I was going from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and it called me the <unk>
There were no visual art -- everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my art <unk>
Am I going to do it more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel that <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me about how to sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I introduced it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, social currency.
In the back of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that I could <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you.
I chose to tell you.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like not had a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as equal as and becoming my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like to take a set of a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could put it in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't actually capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said to a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning as much of the signals like sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so that you can better understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is split into a lot of different <unk>
If it's assigned a different parameter for each finger while the piano is <unk> like the facial expression movement, the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so as you play the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get a game at the same time.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers <unk> to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If you only would change the chord there, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens to the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> using these different <unk> parameters can be expressing different ideas.
For example, the signal is going to be <unk>
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is the day."
If you go through it, and you look at the visual speed, you see it as a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same is the same thing to be said to you as well."
"All the day?"
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present one gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in the same time."
Look at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
Everyone in the top.
Now we're going to do this as much in your head as a chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this -- please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take it again.
And again, again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all come up with the head and the chest -- but they actually transmit very different thoughts.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and successful as the music.
However, today, we live in a very unequal world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have a sound, automatically has no social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a society more <unk>
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to take you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom has responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a ignorance bubble -- I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning the other of others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and teach and invention in the South African school.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk across the beach with lots and lots of trash.
So as a good citizens, <unk> the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge boats
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a <unk>
We started to build this <unk> work with <unk> so that the children really <unk> they can participate.
And I'm going to tell you children that manipulate electrical tools are really cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it the size we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids get a lot with the robots.
Then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we end before lunch.
And we turned light bulbs and web cameras in mockingbird and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly by the water and by plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating floating through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each particle, to get a measure of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're trying to be trying to solve it immediately.
So I was looking at my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are children very <unk>
Do you see the news, you look at the Internet, and you get rid of this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> in the world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> where the water is where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown and when you all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to look at what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can take it through all sorts of things that produce spectra of different kinds of things that can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
And I was forced to investigate a problem at <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half of French and probably remember, that in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it began to start several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> and many cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant close to water.
And today, according to the reports by the average of 300 tons still are leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the most part, the moment, it has all the time, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the crash and doing independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we would like we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night we went down to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Along with them we discussed the data, we discussed that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So we were able to notice that the radioactive dust <unk> from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organize a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a mile from the nuclear level, and with the <unk> aid aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a tracking device as we invented and built and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem at a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, as well as open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of so much, we found an industrial <unk> in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, a little bit of biology, basically, can you build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality, with adults, and where adults can be kids again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with the renewable energy?
For example.
Or well, we can help in mobility of the age of age transforming their standard wheelchair chairs into new motor vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave for our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect children of the horrific truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators, <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk dragline
One of them is synthetic -- it's a synthetic one.
One is a <unk> on the environment, the other believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we take all the information for every cell to work and to get to it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production in mass.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores here.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts mainly like filter the other primarily as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that fundamentally vary its functionality through variation.
Here is a divided screen that represents the <unk> of every designer and an architect in the working between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and analysis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, it tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about it 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment where we get four disciplines that offers designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And on the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet your minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools at scale, such as this robotic arm with a <unk> basis that one day not very far back to print <unk> buildings and graphics to the nanoscale made of genetically altered <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is unique to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion <unk> of Paris with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second <unk> of one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing collaborator -- we print this layer and 3D skirt without <unk> between cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combine rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner, too.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and the instruments -- it allows you to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the comfortable structural chair, and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern -- becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature is its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk>
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and actually define a lot of what really matters.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between the trunk, the branches, and it <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, land did grow trees with twigs, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often wondered, "What would design be if the objects were made of one piece of piece?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we were looking for the material to put the material out of the tree in the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million metric tons produced every year for organisms as shrimp, crabs, and <unk>
We think that if we could tune in your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  <unk> a bunch of husks <unk> the <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structure, there was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made of a single <unk> material -- 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it dry to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing a plastic <unk>
The air bubbles that were a <unk> of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet -- <unk> billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically designed bacteria to capture the carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> to mesh and if it <unk> even more, <unk>
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure from husks of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to <unk> them in the sea, <unk> life and placed in the ground, help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration of the design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we made our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid reuse, just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these agricultural crops.
In our first piece of clothing, it is <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that inhabit in the human intestine.
One makes light in sugar, the other eats sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never get away.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like a digestive tract -- that will help the flow of these bacteria and to turn them into their way.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, including the properties of material as the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> more transparent channels.
This <unk> system <unk> when it stretch out of one end to another, is 60 meters.
This is half of the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our small intestine
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in life within your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we would call our skin -- <unk> the tissues, and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is known to <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which they <unk>
<unk> is not going to go on to this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers into each other.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we put a small magnet on the head of a silk worm.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of cocoon of silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not inside a box, we realized that we would have a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that shape, the composition, the structure of <unk> <unk> directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> to the darker and <unk> areas that we use is we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat -- distributes the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to get us up with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they got eggs, and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and was right.
By <unk> biological silk about <unk> <unk> they give all this condition their integrity.
And in little over two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to make the products and the buildings around us, to form a different ecology of two materials, designers need to unite these two visions of the world.
It takes us back to the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of design, which demands for us, for the first time, to take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were asked for the first time this?
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and the art and ran websites and web, he played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I was excited about something else, something completely different, and I would tell you about it, and I am going to be <unk> and I feel <unk> I have found this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I did so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me because of nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or to be surrounded, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
Let me tell you where we did it, they learned about culture.
Do you first ask yourself, "What do you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would expect.
It's considered a naive question to make beautiful responses in children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done to us again and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students that are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream about what they might be, is not inspired to dream anything they might be.
In fact, just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, but even though well-intentioned adults probably <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> and the creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have a choice.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of manifest or real calling -- the idea that each of us has something to do during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and to devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who's not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that show up their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And you feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a breath by what to say.
Could it help divide in three parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use the other terms that we will use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance, the ideal was the ideal was that I was okay with multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It will take any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, visualization of data, and mathematics and design, the <unk>
<unk> is a company which creates jewelry.
To <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea that was unique by its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
And then you come from the new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, can you access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower, is learning about fast.
When we <unk> we become a bit of something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be clear, so many times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are attached to other disciplines, and we bring everything we have learned from every new area that we rarely have learned from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a completely full-time time and author independent.
As a young girl, <unk> an incredible ability to develop heart memory.
Now, she's the fastest known one.
Before he turned into a writer, <unk> it was a financial planner, it was money.
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they were starting their thumb, and this ability help to write that compelling <unk> for editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to get to what you're going to do, even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field, a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower, is the adaptability. That is to be able to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, and other online designer designer -- sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take a lot of <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Magazine defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can be able to be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning, and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be <unk> if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
They come from the belly by knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into deep and putting into ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to be connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part are encouraging them to just be more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said this, if there's one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then, they will spread through all the media.
That's where you can give the best of them.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with her many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring brings us to a more and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I had a woman named <unk> they took her to a psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't even remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until it passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found weird <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
But the most surprising thing.
If you had been living today, we couldn't give her to her more help than he <unk> him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved very much.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has gotten progress in treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live to the age of 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you have the likelihood that you spend their years from Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or being dear to Alzheimer's disease.
For only in America, Alzheimer's dollars costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs <unk> an increase in five times in 2050, by 2050, as the generation of <unk> booms as well.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively short for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 main causes of death across the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be allowed to cure or even slow down its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer cancer than Alzheimer's percent of the fact that we costs more Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can get rid of it.
For most of the last few years, all of the last few <unk> -- all the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just look at a picture of a healthy generation of healthy brain compared to the disease of a Alzheimer's Alzheimer's to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduced reducing life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of the molecules of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these points -- they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates, and <unk>
That's what we see in patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of which step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
They took a wire to do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that it is, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, it's been reduced by the wires and waited for the <unk>
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, and physical engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that pump specifically this way to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick between each other inside of them, as humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive results, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope about what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to warn you: that Alzheimer's is a disease that if we can measure it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have organized more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move on the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the <unk> the caregivers of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases of a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
In love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and in my own experience as I test it -- I was just one night in the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will be made up to make 36 more and more personal questions and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would go to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to tell your partner what you like about him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled upon this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, I had somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
But we got back and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send him to the column, <unk> a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I suppose some of you are probably asking yourself, they are still <unk>
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because they've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is exactly what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had <unk> to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually only about my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times will probably have a few thousand noticed.
And that came a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as it became made, I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and the Saturday, this was in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the "Today you have and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received more than eight million views, and I was, by saying something, a little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing with each other, but another thing is to discover that life loving an international news has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were going to first the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And some messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for Saint <unk> that included the experiences of readers to test the study on them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> the requests for us two.
I think that I was afraid of becoming the icons in the <unk> process, a range of range that I didn't feel at the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked -- they wanted to know whether it really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially -- that people said the wrong question.
How do you know whether or not, and <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> <unk> among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were closer to the participants after doing that, several later studies, they also used <unk> protocol as well as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and community -- and they used it between people from the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, the one I proved last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and it didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you love you from the person with whom you do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 -- and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to pretty much my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I was interested in science.
And I did all of what I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just worked for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I'm after.
But I can also see it more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than reasonably than reasonably to demand me.
What I'm looking for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some ways to mitigate some way of <unk> and this is a very controversial story, because fall in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that question: still follow together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, we would say that let's make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How are they going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with a doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's true, but because at the moment, there was no thought everything that people were supposed to be.
And I didn't think that a few times would have that decision, and how much I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and ask 36 questions, and I have chosen to love somebody as a kind of <unk> kind and fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think.
And what I knew, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't do.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian on full <unk> and in a way, I got like a <unk> of the forest.
I had a time to New York City a time.  Something that affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and it would take a dollar ticket and a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some of the strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
And at a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and <unk> and all of those things -- and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took out all the pages and I made a sort of <unk> <unk> the style Agnes Martin, the <unk> of resin and a bee fell in.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and she's <unk> them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, the opposite happened. In some way it seemed like it was growing up as a size, as if it was that we were able to put the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, these strange bottles that I would find on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow from <unk> drawing just like a body of the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, you will be able to make an idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning a little bit of money to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I got interested in the human form of human form of <unk> <unk> with drawings of human beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I get stuck.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, which is similar to drawing on a window, then in the other window, and then another window -- and I had all these windows together forming a three-dimensional composition here.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work -- with something very big that I call <unk>
For the <unk> inspired me largely in "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures with children's heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where creatures with animals with animals are heading to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made out of thousands of elements.
This is a god <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while after the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a mythological thing that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a bit of a narrative.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird peak and spitting out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail.
Anyway, its tail turn into a <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
And its tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> terrorist cards from 1986.
You've got them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each of them is a file of our culture, through media and material that are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each other one acts as a kind of file in the form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, and it can be <unk>
I'm going to be with you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that goes out of the chest, and it covers you the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't tell you for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This is two minutes, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into this weird statue <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a writer, a writer a <unk> a <unk> a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
We cut the box and all the people inside it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first passes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It will take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any medicine actually impacts your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs -- these are <unk> to lower the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the cell cells count.
But they are also known for their side side effects on its negative most negative effects because in the time that it takes to get to the current <unk> they will be <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to its destination, which is where it's more important: in the warehouse <unk>
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go easily in the blood stream of the patients that are attached to regular drugs with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, though, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with today's drugs that are a <unk> treatment for <unk> life.
One day, I sat down and I thought, "Let's make the treatment directly in the warehouse of the virus, not the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery, you can use it for anything else -- including transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or <unk> holes that open and close holes -- and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "How is that <unk>
We ship a little ray and a powerful ray ray about the cell cells infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
<unk> cuts through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you noticed, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or on <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and he's headed to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug -- it frees up directly in the site of infection, whereas the laser is using again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher researcher in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups of armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these movements of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to conflict -- not violent.
I do work work in the field of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be an dispute between states.
anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, the <unk> peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> was signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what it motivates these organizations.
We know very well about the reasons why they are doing it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups are now complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s creation has also set up a political party a political party and a network of social services and a military services.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide bombers against Israel, also runs the Gaza from Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking multitasking people.
We put a complex machinery of communication stations. channels, TV websites and Internet websites and social networking strategies.
And here you have the <unk> printed magazine in English and published for <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but by using business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to better recruit and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they put professional hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population of offering something that the state not <unk> safety and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be understood by the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling an empty gap by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006, Palestinian <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid groups.
<unk> because they fill up gaps <unk> by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in violent struggle and cause governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated things are these organizations, less we can do it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They were part of a territory running out of a landscape, running the garbage, run the garbage system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the shorter the states, like in the Middle East of the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
<unk> that empty government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand the groups of the groups, we will understand better what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but we don't give peace nor stability.
To achieve these targets we need long-term investment in order to fill that gap of security, to fill that empty government that allowed these groups to thrive in a very beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a woman as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid we're going to accept the <unk> tag that would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad enough.
And so I got a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated throughout the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to the <unk> who might be feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word and unpleasant word.
I was telling you as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks too much, with high self-worth and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that female <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
And over time, as I was growing up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would have the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use <unk> and accessible to control and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> or doctrines or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have on account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition and skills and so much more.
We need to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I went to work, I hear rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends the women and offends the classic <unk> the classic <unk> of yin yang yang is amazing.
<unk> actually with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
And I'm completely <unk> by musical card.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the tasks that I don't want to do, but kill insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it is your choice, and I'm not who I could do for them."
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem isn't that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that makes women financially vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism thing that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women color, and <unk> and <unk> for women -- white, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good Feminism is a very bad feminist feminist guy.
It also happens as this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we're going to be able to make it right.
When we get sick, we take them very good from the same <unk> where the <unk>
And as I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to take myself from that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what that <unk> is not able to meet the <unk> expectations.
Let's take for example, or as I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> from 2014, in front of the word <unk> from three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this star on the pop star embracing Feminism and to make women and young men and young men that being feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started debates opening up if we were at a feminist.
<unk> your feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk> a lot.
We're going much beyond the sensible criticism of <unk> and <unk> to give you the feminism of every woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little more courageous one.
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists who would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply of <unk>
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they were able to restore change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why is his music so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this it makes it more difficult for women to achieve the equality, gender equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright and too brave. I want to grow up in a world.
Where they were told by the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is going to be much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is trying to treat sexual violence against women as sports, and <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film somewhere else.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, the men, especially men and heterosexuals can say, "No, I'm not going to publish your magazine, participate in his project, or working with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of <unk>
Those of us who are <unk> but we will encourage them to participate in this kind of projects, we can also adapt to being including as much as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision-making.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without taking these <unk> our accomplishments will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in the power and film producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell you with the courage that is good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> to be a bad feminist -- not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say that, above all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't get to believe I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little courageous woman, another woman could come up and see that none of us is anything that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I am a good parent, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need such a courage.
Right after Christmas last year, I got kids in California had measles because he visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus went through the border with Canada, <unk> to over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that anybody who can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century century -- but a lot of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that led us to the autism and the <unk> vaccines that long, marked by being an appraisal fraud by the British Medical Prize.
I don't think most of the smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rising estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her creating their own professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence kept stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> models like <unk> <unk> are referred to routinely applying autism as an epidemic as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Center for Disease Control of Disease Control -- what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and "a better <unk> detection to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son of two years, the eye contact.
If the diagnosis criteria had to <unk> why were they so <unk>
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slower progress and <unk> of science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how the autism discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed <unk> a private worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours waving their hands before their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> as when we don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as they pick up references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give you that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he gets rid of that he had turned to nine out of 10 children to their doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
It <unk> autism as a form of suicide <unk> caused by cold parents and <unk>
And these kids, he said, has been kept carefully in a refrigerator and not <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that are set in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in the clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite <unk> he was properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like children were simply telling their parents to <unk> desperate to win their approval by winning their approval by winning their approval by winning their approval on it.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, turning invisible into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the <unk> theory of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as black-eyed Susie! No special education, no access to other resources without diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse as well.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In the other way, these kids don't <unk> in beautiful frames and <unk> like <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one didn't get rid of these children before?
But then <unk> I found one reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to <unk> and then <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but he avoided <unk> on his own work.
There was not even a translation in the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was translated for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Asperger's who was running an integrated clinic with a grant in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises with music, and kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a disability <unk> of life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of dealing with children in their clinic as patients, while we call them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always had been, seeing aspects of this continuum on <unk> known in pop culture like awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was more there even until the success in science and art, a little bit of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the <unk> of the diagnosis that <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a wide and <unk> <unk>
These changes were not fell in broken off.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, we were able to say what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition and <unk> recognition -- with four awards on <unk> <unk> psychologists, the teachers and parents around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected that it off, make the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. A simple, powerful story, and <unk> credible story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of the 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, people are autistic in the Internet to refuse the idea that are the puzzles for solving by the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of the terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it's suffering from a attention deficit to detail.
Without doubt, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Asperger's and it creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, communities, parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we go to a uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain anymore.
Thank you.
